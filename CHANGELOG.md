## [Unreleased]

### Added

- API: `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/v1/audio/translations` accept
  opt-in `return_speaker_embeddings=true` with `diarize=true` and
  `response_format=verbose_json`. The response then includes a WhisperX/Speakr
  `speaker_embeddings` map plus sibling `speaker_embedding_space` metadata
  copied from already-computed diarization centroids. Default requests omit
  both fields. Remote-compute device tokens requesting the field receive HTTP
  403 `authorization_error`; operator and loopback clients are unrestricted.
- Subtitles: transcription results now keep readable paragraphs separate from
  short subtitle cues. JSON responses expose `subtitle_cues` and
  `timeline_quality`; SRT/VTT render the cue view. The server also provides
  `POST /v1/audio/precise-timeline` to refine an existing transcript against
  its source audio, or to force-align a user-supplied plain-text manuscript
  (`transcript` form field) onto the audio, when the Qwen3 Forced Aligner
  capability pack is installed. `openasr align` is the matching CLI.
- Forced alignment of an external transcript fails closed when the aligner
  pack is missing, the language is Japanese/Korean, the normalized text is
  empty, the audio exceeds the aligner's timestamp grid, or the resulting
  timeline is degenerate (collapsed bins / zero-duration words).
- CLI: `openasr bench-receipt short-audio` writes a machine-readable receipt
  for a measured short-audio run, binding the report to the selected pack,
  source audio, runtime settings, and recorded measurements.
- Voice ID: local file transcription now has one model-independent speaker
  pipeline. `moss-transcribe-diarize` keeps its in-decoder speaker turns; every
  other ASR family uses the shared FireRed Stream-VAD + speaker-segmenter +
  ReDimNet2-B6 + automatic clustering path. Both sources converge on the same
  recording-local labels, evidence gates, enrolled-person matching, and
  transcript attribution instead of each ASR family growing its own Voice ID
  integration.
- Diarization: a native DiariZen Large-s80-md-v2 segmenter runtime and staged pack
  contract are available for qualification. Its checkpoint is CC BY-NC 4.0,
  the staged source is not in either downloadable catalog, and only an fp16
  candidate is supported. segmentation-3.0 stays the
  permissive default unless a future product release explicitly offers and the
  user consents to the optional DiariZen download.
- Catalog: Fun-ASR-Nano (`funasr-nano`) and Granite Speech 4.1 2B (`granite-speech-4.1-2b`) are public in the signed catalog; both ship fp16 / q8_0 / q4_k packs on Hugging Face under the OpenASR namespace, with min_cli/core floor 0.1.27.
- Core: Fun-ASR-Nano family (SAN-M/DFSMN encoder + adaptor + Qwen3-0.6B decoder; keep-quantized resident path) and Granite Speech 4.1 2B family (Conformer + Q-Former + 2B decoder; keep-quantized Metal path; decoder-context-derived 382s single-buffer `AudioTooLong` ceiling).
- Server: `GET /v1/audio/transcriptions/{id}/progress` reports the progress of one specific file transcription. Native progress is tracked per request id instead of in a single process-wide slot, so concurrent transcriptions each report their own phase and fraction. Previously the first request to publish claimed the only writable slot and every other request's progress publish was a no-op until that owner finished.
- CLI: `openasr model-pack usage`, `model-pack gc`, and `model-pack verify` report where model-pack storage has gone, reclaim unreferenced content and dead installer scratch, and re-hash every installed pack against its recorded digest. The model store is now content-addressed (objects keyed by sha256, named by refs), migrated automatically from the previous per-quant layout on first startup; installed packs, downloads, and capability-pack lookups all resolve through the new layout.
- Voice ID: speaker identity is judged from fixed 2.0s/1.0s sub-windows taken inside single-speaker spans rather than from a whole segment, so a segment straddling a speaker change no longer produces a blended embedding that defeats naming. Speaker attribution metadata is now persisted and user-editable, with idempotent enrollment and schema migration from the legacy format.
- Long-form: `moss-transcribe-diarize` now decodes long recordings as scoped slices instead of one continuous prompt, so a meeting or film past its ~7-minute decoder context limit is transcribed in full instead of failing outright.
- CLI: `openasr model-pack import moss` and `openasr model-pack import qwen-forced-aligner` build runtime packs (`.oasr`) for those two families from local source weights, alongside the existing family importers.
- CLI: `openasr model-pack audit-quant <path|url>` audits one pack's tensor quantization against the current policy (the audio-encoder Q8_0 floor, plus the declared-tier ceiling when `--quant` is given) from the GGUF header alone -- no download, no inference -- and works against a local file or an http(s) URL via a range-fetched header prefix.
- GGUF packs now carry a `openasr.build.commit` metadata key recording the open-core commit they were built from; `openasr show` renders it for a local pack.
- Audio input: bare ADTS `.aac` (what WeChat and many other recorders/voice-memo apps emit, as opposed to an `.m4a`/`.mp4` container), `.m4b` (audiobook), `.aiff`/`.aif`/`.aifc`, and `.caf` now decode in-process, with no external converter needed; `.wma` and `.amr` are now recognized and routed through the existing external ffmpeg/afconvert conversion path (neither has an in-process decoder). Previously all seven of these were rejected outright as an unsupported extension.
- Core: `moss-transcribe-diarize` requests are now rejected with a clear, actionable error before the decode graph is built if the host's memory budget (75% of total RAM) plainly cannot fit the request's decoder KV cache plus the model pack -- naming how much was needed, how much this host offers, and what to try instead (a smaller quantization or model, or freeing memory), instead of surfacing later as an opaque `ggml cpu graph backend buffer allocation failed`. The check only refuses when certain the request will not fit; other native families are unaffected this round.
- Voice ID: the `json`/`verbose_json` response bodies now carry a top-level `unnamed_speakers` array, one entry per speaker label the transcript could not put a name to, each with a machine-readable reason (`not-enough-speech`, `mixed-voices`, `no-match-in-library`, `embedder-unavailable`) plus the evidence behind it (seconds heard, the continuous-speech figure still needed, whether the library is empty). Previously a client had no way to distinguish "too short to judge" from "nobody enrolled" from "the speaker model is missing" -- every case just looked like the feature silently not working.
- Server: `/health` now reports `voice_id_min_enrollment_speech_seconds`, the minimum accepted speech for one enrollment sample, so a client has a single source of truth to read instead of hand-copying the number.

### Changed

- Core: `--diarize` / Voice ID now installs the native execution broker
  before Stream-VAD and ReDimNet admission. 0.1.37 failed closed with
  `could not load the vendored FireRed Stream-VAD` because those weights
  started requiring the process-wide broker after GPU ownership work, but
  NES was only installed around speaker-turn computation.
- Core: tearing down a scheduler-backed persistent graph (MOSS decode on
  macOS, and any `start_graph` then persistent-session handoff) no longer
  use-after-frees inside `ggml_backend_sched_reset`. Reset detaches the
  scheduler-owned split graph instead of a caller cgraph that may already
  have been parked, and the idle runner context is reset before it is
  freed. 0.1.37 exited 139 after a successful moss-transcribe-diarize
  CPU/Metal run.
- Core: a DedicatedDevice quarantine from a terminal device failure can
  recover when a later candidate presents a healthy heap snapshot (new
  backend generation after the poisoned handle was leaked). Ledger
  corruption stays sticky until process restart. SystemMemory still never
  disables the independent CPU fallback.
- Core: discrete GPU activation no longer forecasts the pack mmap as a second
  VRAM copy. Weights are reserved once at allocation, so packs near half of
  card memory (for example `mimo-v2.5-asr:q4` on 12 GiB) admit instead of
  fail-closed. CUDA FullDevice reuses the ggml graph on the same proven lane
  as HIP/Vulkan.
- Core: already-open file-backed pack mappings still occupy the SystemMemory
  policy ledger so two distinct packs fail closed, but they no longer consume
  this candidate's observed-free remainder or crowd out its later anonymous
  host allocations and graph buffers. UMA hosts can load a pack larger than
  live free (for example `firered2-llm:q4` or `mimo-v2.5-asr:q4` on 16 GiB)
  and still admit encoder metadata, prepared-runtime counters, reuse-pass
  weight contexts, and long-form graph workspace.
- Core: growing-KV seq2seq logits read directly into caller storage now keep
  the native compute witness. Granite Metal token steps no longer fail
  short-audio receipts with `token step has no native compute witness`.
- Core: a discrete CUDA/HIP/Vulkan request now keeps encoder and decoder
  graphs on one unified GPU owner, so weights and KV stay on a single ggml
  actor instead of bouncing between thread-local caches.
- Core: CUDA/HIP graph capture is reserved for persistent reuse sessions.
  One-shot encoder/prefill graphs no longer instantiate HIP fragment
  executables. The capture flag lives in ggml-impl, not the hashed host ABI.
- ggml/Vulkan: DeviceLocal weight buffers prefer memory types that are not
  also HostVisible. On ReBAR discrete GPUs those heaps are still HostVisible
  to the process; the plugin skips mapping them and copies through chunked
  staging. SPIR-V float-controls patching is opt-in (the host disables it
  unless the operator sets `GGML_VK_ENABLE_FLOAT_CONTROLS_PATCH`).
- Qwen3 Forced Aligner now publishes the policy-guarded `q4_k` tier as its
  recommended default. Boundary-sensitive audio, token-embedding, and
  timestamp-head matrices remain Q8_0; legacy all-Q4, Q3, and mislabeled mixed
  packs fail closed.
- Core: built-in model families now share the runtime admission, resource
  ownership, request-progress, and importer/tokenizer building blocks while
  retaining their family-specific graph and decode behavior.
- Core: scheduler-backed graph stages release their completed transient working
  sets before the next stage is admitted. DiariZen persistent graphs and
  Qwen3 Forced Aligner prefill also use bounded-liveness allocation paths.
- Voice ID: ReDimNet2-B6 now embeds independent speech windows through the
  ordered batch seam, reuses content-keyed resident runtimes, and freezes one
  exact pack snapshot for the entire request. Parallel work preserves input
  order and cancellation while pack replacement cannot mix embedding spaces in
  one transcript.
- CLI: `openasr verify` now runs the same quantization-floor audit `model-pack audit-quant` performs (the audio-encoder Q8_0 floor, plus the declared-tier ceiling) against every local pack it checks, and fails closed on a violation. A pack that previously passed `openasr verify` on tensor structure alone may no longer pass if its quantization does not meet the floor.
- CLI: `openasr model-pack verify` now re-seals (marks read-only) any object it re-hashes and finds intact, so a store whose file permissions were lost -- for example a backup restored without them -- gets its fast, no-rehash object identity back after one verify pass.
- Core: `pull` no longer re-hashes an already-installed, sealed pack before deciding to skip its download; it trusts the digest named by the object's own path once the seal is intact. A same-size, in-place corruption of an installed pack (bit rot, or a backup restored to the same bytes-mostly-but-not-quite state) is therefore no longer self-healed by re-running `pull` -- run `openasr model-pack verify` to detect and, once re-sealed, recover from that case instead.
- Server: `GET /v1/audio/transcriptions/progress` (the id-less form) keeps its exact response body while at most one native transcription is active, and now returns `409 Conflict` when more than one is. It used to return an unattributed snapshot belonging to whichever request held the global slot, which a caller had no way to distinguish from its own. Clients polling progress should move to the id-scoped route above.
- Core: a family's execution backend is resolved once per request by the shared dispatch, from the request's own backend preference and that family's declared `AutoGpuPolicy`, and handed to the family as an explicit value. Families can no longer resolve it themselves -- the resolvers are private to `ggml_runtime` and `GgmlCpuGraphConfig::default()` no longer answers "what backend should this request use" -- so a single request cannot observe two different backends at two graph-build sites, and a family that declares a gated policy cannot be handed a backend that policy excludes. Qwen and firered-llm previously reached a resolver that bypassed the family gate on several paths, and qwen's serve-batch worker thread re-resolved instead of reading the value materialized on the submitting thread.
- Local pack import (server `POST /v1/models/local/import`, FFI `openasr_install_local_pack`) now requires the file's sha256/size to match an entry in the signed public catalog; a local `.oasr` that is not in the catalog is rejected instead of being installed under an identity derived from its own metadata or filename. This closes an install path that bypassed catalog signature verification. Import a build published to the catalog, or use the catalog pull path directly.
- Model installation now uses one open-core license policy across CLI, server,
  and FFI: non-commercial and vendor-gated packs require explicit acceptance
  even when the source is a local file, unknown license classes fail closed,
  and permissive packs need no acknowledgement. Server pull jobs persist that
  acceptance proof so daemon restart/resume cannot invent consent; old
  restricted snapshots without proof fail closed while old permissive jobs
  remain resumable. The existing FFI local-install ABI remains compatible for
  permissive packs, and `openasr_install_local_pack_v2` adds the explicit
  acceptance argument required for restricted packs.
- `Transcription` gained a required `truncated_decodes` field reporting every decode behind the transcript that stopped before describing all of its audio (guard cut short or budget exhausted), surfaced end to end: a `truncated` array in the `json`/`verbose_json` response bodies, an `x-openasr-truncated` response header (bounded to a fixed prefix plus a count on long transcripts) on every format, and a CLI warning. Previously only `moss-transcribe-diarize` tracked this internally and every other family, plus moss's own single-pass path, reported a guard-truncated decode as an ordinary complete success. Rust API consumers constructing a `Transcription` directly must now set this field.
- **Breaking:** Voice ID: the minimum accepted speech for one enrollment sample (`MIN_SAMPLE_SPEECH_SECONDS`) is raised from 5.0s to 10.0s, to sit above recognition's own naming floor (8.0s) with a margin -- an enrollment that only just cleared the old floor could already fail the very next recognition attempt, since real speech is consistently thinner evidence than an enrollment prompt's read-aloud passage for the same nominal seconds. A sample between 5 and 10 seconds of detected speech that previously enrolled now fails quality assessment with the same "too short" error, pointing the user at a longer re-record.

### Fixed

- Core: live capture no longer panics when a downsampled mic callback (for
  example 44.1 kHz stereo in 512-frame chunks) leaves the resampler read head
  past the current buffer. The leftover position continues in the next chunk
  instead of draining past the held samples.
- Core: long-form slices no longer exceed the decoder-state `max_chunk`
  envelope after overlap, packing, or a short-tail remainder. A request that
  previously failed closed with `decoder invocation lies outside its declared
  session envelope` and no partial transcript now emits windows at or under
  the same integer ceiling the executor already declared, while still cutting
  on a nearby pause when one exists.
- Windows: HE-AAC (and other formats the in-process decoder cannot handle)
  fall back to Media Foundation to produce 16 kHz mono PCM16 WAV, the same
  role `/usr/bin/afconvert` plays on macOS. AAC-LC and bare ADTS stay
  in-process. If system decoding also fails, the error says so and points at
  ffmpeg.
- Windows: promoting an installed GPU backend pack retries antivirus directory
  locks (`os error 5` / sharing / lock violation) and copies the readable
  staging tree if rename stays locked. A failed copy does not leave a truncated
  directory that the next install would treat as already complete.
- HIP decode reuse no longer recaptures every token after the first stable
  capture: uid reuse keys on node count, op, type, and shape, and ignores
  input-pointer churn that HIP writes on each launch.
- ggml: throwaway Vulkan/HIP plugin probes now release their device contexts
  instead of leaving them in the process working set.
- `ggml`: unsupported Metal flash-attention head widths now select the existing
  non-flash attention path before graph construction instead of failing the
  request.
- Server: native boot warm-up preserves the first causal failure in its startup
  diagnostic instead of wrapping it in later generic errors.
- Core: MOSS decoder admission derives its actor memory quote from the prepared
  decoder plan, keeping the preflight estimate aligned with the graph it will
  execute.
- Voice ID: external diarization now treats the recording-wide speaker timeline
  as the shared source of truth for both transcript attribution and enrolled
  identity matching. Coarse ASR segments that cross speaker changes are split
  on native word anchors or the shared forced aligner, and fail closed when
  trustworthy word alignment is unavailable, instead of assigning the whole
  segment to its dominant speaker.
- Server: uploading a file whose extension this build did not (yet) recognize as decodable used to fail with "the file has no extension" -- a lie for any upload that plainly did have one. The server derived the upload's own temp-file suffix from the decodable-extension whitelist, silently stripping any other extension before the file ever reached audio preparation; that whitelist now only governs whether the format decodes, not whether the extension is safe to keep on disk, so the real extension always reaches preparation and an unsupported upload's error now names it correctly.
- Server: `POST /v1/voice-id/persons/from-audio` (and the matching add-sample route) now converts non-WAV and non-conformant WAV `source_audio` uploads the same way every other native-backend audio input does. The route was missing the switch that turns on in-process decode/external conversion, so any upload that was not already a 16 kHz mono PCM WAV -- an mp3, an m4a, a 44.1 kHz stereo wav -- was rejected outright instead of being prepared.
- Server: the voice-id from-audio routes' conversion path now follows the operator-configured ffmpeg binary (`media.ffmpeg_bin` / `OPENASR_FFMPEG_BIN` / `--ffmpeg-bin`) and the runtime's configured backend, the same as every other native-backend upload. It previously always assumed no ffmpeg was configured, so a non-macOS host with ffmpeg explicitly set up still hit the codec's unsupported-format failure for any format outside the in-process decoder's coverage. Decoding also now runs on a blocking-task worker instead of the async runtime's own thread, matching the transcription route, so a large or slow-converting upload can no longer stall other concurrent requests.
- Core: a `.wav` input the built-in decoder cannot parse (a corrupt file, or a codec outside what this build supports) now goes through the same external ffmpeg/afconvert fallback every other unsupported format already used, instead of being silently passed through untouched and only failing much later downstream with a generic "expected 16 kHz mono PCM" error that pointed at the wrong problem (sample rate) when the real issue was the codec. The error now names the detected codec when the demuxer identified one. MS-ADPCM and IMA-ADPCM wav (common output of dictaphones, older recording software, and conferencing systems) now decode in-process with no external tool needed at all.
- Core: the already-conformant WAV passthrough check now parses the `fmt` chunk through the same subformat-unwrapping logic the WAV reader itself uses, instead of a second, stricter copy that treated every WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE wav -- including the shape macOS `afconvert` always produces -- as non-conformant. Those files used to reach symphonia's own, stricter extensible parser instead of the cheap passthrough they qualify for, which could silently regress a shorter or non-canonical extensible header (as seen from some hardware recorders and conferencing systems) from passthrough to a hard ffmpeg-required failure.
- Core: garbage collection on the model store now treats an unreadable `refs/` directory (or a `config.json` that fails to parse) as a reason to refuse to run rather than as an empty store or a fallback to the default models directory; either used to risk collecting an object a ref still pointed at, or running a destructive command against the wrong directory.
- Voice ID: main-cluster filtering now keeps every window of a label whose AHC split lands at or under the same distance the mixed-voice verdict uses, instead of always discarding the split's smaller cluster -- a genuinely single voice whose windows happen to split into two near-identical clusters no longer loses part of its evidence to an unconditional cut. Naming's turning point on the ladder recordings unifies to 8s across all three sources, down from a previously inconsistent 9-12s.
- Server: the `x-openasr-truncated` response header lists at most a fixed number of truncated-decode entries plus a total count instead of spelling every one out; an unbounded header on a long, badly degraded transcript could reach roughly 180 entries and exceed common reverse-proxy header-size limits (e.g. nginx's default `proxy_buffer_size`). The full list remains in the JSON response body.
- Core: capability pack resolution (Voice ID, pyannote speaker segmentation, forced alignment, punctuation restoration) now finds packs installed under the content-addressed store. It previously only scanned `models/` for a directory name matching a hint substring, so every capability silently reported itself unavailable on a store that had migrated to the new layout.
- Core: the shared greedy decode driver's degenerate-repeat guard is now tiered by n-gram length instead of one flat four-cycle bound, and a recording short enough to decode in a single pass is no longer sliced first. The flat bound tripped on ordinary short backchannel repetition (e.g. "对对对对") and ended the decode outright, discarding the rest of the recording.
- Core: long-form slice planning for scoped-slice families (`moss-transcribe-diarize`) now always produces full-coverage slices instead of an energy-packed layout that could silently elide low-level speech as silence, and the coverage check that is meant to catch a bad plan now judges dropped audio against the whole recording rather than against the same energy floor the packer used to decide what to drop -- a check that read its own input back can never fail.
- `moss-transcribe-diarize`: a decode cut short by the degenerate-repeat guard no longer closes its final speaker segment at the end of the audio and reports it as an ordinary complete result; the guard's stop is now distinguished from a real end-of-stream and the segment closes where the decode actually stopped.
- Core: a cancel now reaches the work it belongs to across thread boundaries. Every cross-thread work object carries an explicit request execution context (typed control plus request id) instead of the control being read from a thread-local that only existed on the submitting thread, so a realtime deferred backend work item, a serve-batch slot, and a longform decode all cancel the request that asked for it. Cancelling one serve-batch slot finishes only that slot and leaves healthy siblings on the shared runtime to complete. Opting out of cancellation now requires a stated reason at the call site rather than being the default a caller can fall into.
- Core: a graph's terminal status is reported by the call that submitted it. Backend, scheduler and event completion barriers return `ggml_status` rather than `void`, so a Metal command-buffer failure surfaces on the graph that failed instead of one graph later, and tensor readback happens only after a success. `DeviceLost` and backend-poisoning failures stick to the backend so a poisoned device is not reused. Requires the vendored ggml backend API version bump; out-of-tree backend plugins built against the previous version fail closed on the version check rather than mismatching the barrier signature.
- Core: replacing an installed `.oasr` pack no longer lets a stale runtime be reused. A runtime's cache identity is the sha256 of the bytes it was actually built from, computed from the same open file mapping the weights are read through, so identity and bytes cannot come from different generations of a file at that path. Path metadata is no longer an identity: the previous memo keyed on file length plus a whole-second mtime, so an equal-length replacement written within the same second returned the old identity and reused the old runtime. Cache invalidation is now per content id, so installing one pack no longer invalidates every other resident runtime in the process.
- Core: reading a LoRA adapter pack no longer opens the file a second time to map tensor data, which could pair a manifest and tensor index from one open with bytes from another.

- Core: in-flight graph cancellation is now one compute-scoped backend/scheduler contract across CPU, Metal, and source-enabled CUDA/HIP/Vulkan/SYCL backends. CPU retains native per-node polling; backends without a native hook execute bounded 32-node graph views with synchronization checkpoints and return typed `GGML_STATUS_ABORTED` instead of silently ignoring cancel. Scheduler checkpoints now also bracket cross-backend input waits/copies (one already-entered backend call remains indivisible), and every aborted/failed persistent compute poisons its graph/session so partially written KV state is discarded and rebuilt before reuse while stateless backend handles and immutable uploaded weights stay cached. The callback pointer is owned only by the synchronous compute call, so cached runtimes cannot retain another job's flag; callback-free CLI and warm-cache paths keep the original async graph submission behavior.
- Server: the shared native-streaming decode worker (one OS thread per model-key, serially processing every attached session's commands) now has a per-attach-scoped watchdog, same-key preemption, and fail-loud recovery, closing three related failure modes that traced back to one structural gap -- a single decode call had no timeout smaller than the WS layer's 300s HTTP-job-oriented default, and a stuck worker OS thread cannot be interrupted (a Metal `waitUntilCompleted` cannot be aborted from another thread): (1) a hung `PushAudio`/`Finish`/etc. call used to leave the WS session waiting up to 300s -- far past the desktop client's own ~8s finalize deadline, so the client gave up and force-restarted the daemon before the server ever reported anything; (2) a new attach for the same model-key queued behind that stuck worker indefinitely, since nothing evicted it; (3) `idle_unload`'s activity accounting stayed pinned non-idle for as long as the stuck (or merely slow-to-notice-its-WS-closed) session's worker thread never returned, delaying the next eviction by however long that took. Every attach now carries its own supervision token (cancel flag, `idle_unload` guard, abandoned flag), recorded as the worker's current occupant by the worker thread itself only once it begins driving that attach, so the watchdog and preemption act on exactly the one attach holding the thread and never poison a healthy sibling queued behind it. The watchdog is a single command-agnostic "the decode is genuinely wedged" bound (60s -- derived from the 30s window cap, worst committed CPU real-time factor, and low-end-hardware margin, and ~7x a real long-utterance finalize) rather than a per-command UX deadline; timely failure stays the desktop client's ~8s job, and the client-disconnect path frees the attach's `idle_unload` guard immediately instead of waiting out the watchdog, so the reaper recovers the moment the client gives up. The abandoned OS thread is deliberately never joined or cancelled, only abandoned (a late-finishing abandoned thread's warm-up can no longer mark the model resident on `/health`'s behalf); after 3 such abandonments -- each a leaked, wedged thread pinning a resident model runtime -- the daemon fails loud and exits so its supervisor can restart it with a clean slate, and `/health` exposes the running `abandoned_worker_count`.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Server: `/health` now reports `model_resident`, whether the bound model's native runtime is currently loaded in memory versus idle-unloaded (or not yet loaded this boot) -- lets clients (e.g. the desktop status indicator) distinguish "ready, instant transcription" from "bound but will pay a cold rebuild on the next request" without guessing from the `idle_unload` timer. Additive; `model_installed` is unchanged.
- Server: `GET /v1/devices` enumerates the daemon's own ggml compute devices (Auto/CPU/accelerated), so a UI can read the backends inference actually runs on instead of enumerating its own runtime -- a shell built in a different backend shape than the sidecar (e.g. a CPU-only desktop supervising a Vulkan sidecar on Windows) previously hid the GPU. Device shaping (`compute_devices_from_runtime`, `default_execution_target`, `ComputeDevice`) lives in `openasr-core` as the single source of truth, reused by the endpoint and by a shell offline fallback.
- Server: the self-signed TLS identity is now persisted to `OPENASR_HOME/tls-identity.json` and reloaded on the next `serve --tls-self-signed` start instead of being regenerated every boot, so the certificate fingerprint (and the pairing safety code derived from it) stays stable across daemon restarts -- including the restart the desktop app performs on every model switch -- and an already-paired remote client no longer has its TOFU pin invalidated and forced to re-pair. An expired identity or one issued for different subject-alt-names still regenerates; a corrupt or unreadable store fails closed to regeneration rather than hard-failing boot. Measured on M1: first-boot keygen takes ~12.4ms; a subsequent boot that loads the persisted identity takes ~0.14ms.
- Dev-only TypeScript bindings (`ts-rs`) are now generated from the realtime WebSocket wire types (`crates/openasr-core/generated/realtime-wire/*.ts`) and from the HTTP daemon's identity/discovery responses -- `/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/capabilities`, `/v1/devices` (`crates/openasr-server/generated/http-wire/*.ts`) -- making the Rust structs the single source of truth instead of hand-duplicated TS types on the desktop side; each is guarded by a golden "regenerate == committed" test. Dev-dependency only, no shipped-binary or wire-behavior change.

### Changed

- Core: the offline and realtime-streaming dispatch stacks now share one process-wide executor instance for qwen, cohere, whisper, and moonshine (the families that host-materialize a prepared runtime instead of relying purely on the pack's own mmap), instead of each stack holding its own independent instance and cache. A model warmed on both stacks no longer pays for its resident weights twice: measured on `qwen3-asr-0.6b` q4_k, warming both stacks on the same pack now costs ~1x instead of ~2x (2965 MiB -> 2197 MiB physical footprint in a same-process repro). A separate pre-release A/B against the v0.1.12 release binary (`qwen3-asr-0.6b` q8_0, real daemon, offline + realtime both warmed) confirms the same effect at larger scale: both-stacks-warm resident memory drops from ~2.8 GiB to ~1.8 GiB (~37% lower), and no longer exceeds a single warmed stack. AED/CTC/transducer families keep zero-copy mmap-shared weights already and are unaffected.
- Core: native runtime capability probing (`/v1/capabilities`, phrase-bias/diarization checks) now builds the GGUF adapter once per call and caches parsed pack metadata for the life of the process instead of re-parsing an installed (content-immutable) pack from disk on every probe -- measured ~286ms/iter down to ~0.66ms/iter on a repeated-probe benchmark. A pre-release A/B against the v0.1.12 release binary (real daemon, 20 installed packs, 50 serial requests) puts the end-to-end `/v1/capabilities` p50 at ~271ms versus ~351ms on v0.1.12 (~22% faster). Realtime boot warm-up now reads the user's saved execution-target/thread preferences instead of always warming the default worker key, so a user who changed those defaults still gets a warm first dictation session instead of a cold rebuild on their actual worker key.
- Core: CTC greedy decode skips the full-vocab softmax confidence computation on frames whose argmax is the blank token (their probability is discarded a few lines later regardless); measured ~3-5x faster on blank-heavy synthetic input, scaling with vocab size. No change to emitted tokens or spans.
- Core: four small startup/hot-path savings -- `serve` now reads `config.json` once at boot instead of twice; the resampler reuses its input/output buffers across chunks instead of reallocating per `RESAMPLE_CHUNK_FRAMES` chunk; the hymt2 translation path caches its per-token profiling env-var read behind a `OnceLock` instead of re-reading it every call; and the native adapter builder only reads the full GGUF tensor index for Dolphin packs (the one family that consults it) instead of unconditionally for every architecture.

### Fixed

- Server: a failed realtime native-streaming attach (the reused-worker send racing a dead decode thread) no longer leaks the process-wide native activity count. The leaked count made `idle_unload`'s reaper read permanently non-idle for the rest of the daemon's life -- silently disabling the resident-model eviction feature with no log or error, and pinning `/health`'s `model_resident` to `true`. The activity accounting is now an RAII guard carried through the attach message itself, so every exit path (successful attach, failed send, or a mid-session worker panic) retires it exactly once.
- Core: `idle_unload` now actually evicts the X-ASR (Zipformer) streaming family's pooled runtimes. Unlike every other builtin family, X-ASR's streaming executor left `unload_idle_state` at its no-op default, so its process-level runtime pool (`XASR_PROCESS_RUNTIME_POOL`) stayed fully resident regardless of how long the daemon sat idle; a subsequent request now rebuilds cleanly from a cold pool, same as every other family. With this fix and the activity-guard fix above, a real end-to-end idle-unload cycle (`qwen3-asr-0.6b`, real daemon) was re-verified on release: resident memory drops by ~765 MiB once the idle threshold trips, and the next request reloads at the same cost as a normal cold load, with no added penalty.
- `ggml`: statically-linked builds (macOS, Linux, and Windows GPU-feature builds where `GGML_BACKEND_DL` is off) no longer unconditionally `dlopen()` every `ggml-*.dll` next to the exe on startup -- harmless on its own, but actively dangerous when the exe directory also carries CPU BACKEND_DL plugin DLLs (e.g. a desktop bundle shipping them for other components): loading a second copy of ggml core collided with the statically-linked copy's global state and fastfailed the process. The backend directory scan is now gated on `OPENASR_GGML_BACKEND_DL_ENABLED` (same pattern as `OPENASR_GGML_NATIVE_ENABLED`); genuine `GGML_BACKEND_DL` builds are unaffected. Also: `catalog.public.json`/`catalog.public.signature.json` were missing from the `eol=lf` rules covering the private catalog trio, so Windows checkouts with `core.autocrlf=true` rewrote them to CRLF and broke the bundled-catalog sha256 signature check (fail-closed, blocking desktop bundling on Windows).
- Consolidated five duplicate f16-bits-to-f32 decode routines into one shared, reference-verified implementation, fixing a subnormal-decode bug in two of them (Whisper safetensors import and general GGUF F16 tensor reads): every subnormal f16 input decoded to exactly half its correct magnitude. Subnormal magnitudes are extremely unlikely in real trained-model weights, but the fix is byte-identical everywhere else (swept and verified against all 65536 `u16` bit patterns).
- `diarize`: the speaker-embedder and VAD fbank frontends now fail closed with a typed error on non-finite (NaN/Inf) audio input instead of silently propagating it through the network; this only changes behavior on already-invalid input, never on valid audio.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- OpenAI API compatibility: `verbose_json` now carries `duration`, segment `id`s, and a top-level `words` array; error envelope includes `param`/`code`; the OpenAI-SDK `stream` form field is rejected with an actionable error instead of silently returning a non-streaming body
- Agent Skill: split into `SKILL.md` + `references/http-api.md` (progressive disclosure) with a verified OpenAI parameter compatibility matrix

- CLI redesign (round 1 + 2): newcomer-friendly subcommand surface, language capability framework, improved help output
- Sentence segmentation for long-form transcription, long-form progress endpoint, and Hugging Face token authentication for gated model pulls
- Full Whisper family (tiny/base/small/medium/large-v3) and remaining ASR models published to catalog; catalog signing pipeline
- Speaker diarization: full pipeline (engine + CLI), CampPlus speaker embedder, per-word speaker labels, diarization export
- Per-word confidence scores across all model families (seq2seq, CTC, X-ASR)
- Word-level timestamps across all families (acoustic cross-attention alignment for Whisper, frame spans for the CTC/transducer families, token-position estimates elsewhere)
- X-ASR (Zipformer) model family: catalog integration, frame-sync streaming, alias resolution
- Realtime translation pipeline: Hy-MT2 pack, streaming translation, HIP GPU support
- GPU backend plugin system (GGML_BACKEND_DL) for Windows; all-AMD HIP arch list
- Realtime translation: livelock fix for mixed-language (CJK + Latin) input
- Windows: UTF-8 console output, PATH executable detection, host RAM/disk probing, mmap'd model re-pull error
- Docker smoke test in CI; serve-batch real-pack parity lane
- Server: the daemon's bound native model pack is now warmed up in the background right after boot (bind), instead of on the first realtime WS attach, so the first dictation session no longer pays the cold model-pack-load cost (observed 1.7-2.1s) before its first partial; `/health` remains unaffected (bind-then-serve, never gated on warm-up)
- Server: `idle_unload` now actually releases the cached native model runtime (mmap/materialized tensors/Metal or CPU graph context) once idle past the configured threshold, freeing the RAM a bound pack otherwise held for the daemon's whole lifetime; a later request just rebuilds it through the normal load-and-warm-up path
- Server: stage timing and timestamps in daemon logs -- server boot, model-pack load, and realtime warm-up are now timestamped (wall-clock + monotonic), and `OPENASR_TIMING=1` adds a finer per-request tier (model resolution, longform slice decode); local-only (stderr), no telemetry
- `pull`: model-pack downloads now split into concurrent 64 MiB range-request segments (`OPENASR_PULL_CONNECTIONS`, default 4) for a 2-4x wall-clock improvement on large packs, with an ETag-guarded probe and automatic fallback to the existing single-stream path when the server does not support Range requests
- CI: release archives (the core fast-path build and the full binaries matrix, including the xcframework) now carry a verifiable SLSA build-provenance attestation (`gh attestation verify`) tying each shipped asset back to the CI run and source tag that built it

### Changed

- Default model changed to `qwen3-asr-0.6b`; Qwen3-ASR family promoted to primary recommendation
- `idle_unload` preference default changed from `never` to `10m`: a bound native model pack is now released from RAM after 10 minutes with no active request/realtime session, instead of staying resident until the daemon exits; an explicitly configured `idle_unload` (including `never`) is unaffected -- only the default changed
- Catalog: dropped ModelScope mirror; unified quant tag scheme (`canonical_quant_tag`)
- Server: extracted config, history, and translation routes into dedicated modules
- Pre-open-source cleanup: removed private docs/artifacts, aligned license metadata, dep hygiene
- Qwen3-ASR: audio encoder self-attention now runs through flash attention by default (opt-out via `OPENASR_QWEN_GGML_DISABLE_AUDIO_ENCODER_FLASH_ATTN`), sharing a Metal head-dim compatibility guard with Whisper's existing flash-attention path
- Dolphin: n-best rescoring now builds the decoder graph once per utterance and reuses it across hypotheses instead of rebuilding and re-uploading ~200 decoder weight tensors per hypothesis; measured on M1 with a 2.38s clip, RTF improves from 0.89/0.72 to 0.34/0.29 (CPU cold/warm) and peak RSS drops from ~3.7 GB to ~1.88 GB

### Fixed

- `serve --model <id>` no longer rejects a catalog-resolved quant-pinned ref against a bare pack runtime id (previously failed with a self-contradictory "requires --model to match local source id 'X', got 'X'" error); the startup gate now uses the same tolerant bare-id matcher as transcribe and the server request path
- `idle_unload` now actually reaches every native model family: the composed dispatch executor (used by Qwen3-ASR) previously inherited a no-op default for the unload hook, so a bound qwen pack's cached runtime never released on idle despite the server reporting the unload; qwen's thread-local decoder cache and the streaming warm-up gate are now keyed on a process-wide unload generation so a decode-worker thread that survives past an eviction re-warms and rebuilds instead of silently serving stale, pre-unload state
- X-ASR (Zipformer) streaming: fixed a use-after-free that could abort the whole daemon (`GGML_ASSERT(device) failed`) when a pooled streaming runtime migrated to a new decode-worker thread after the previous thread's Metal/GPU backend was torn down on its 60s idle release; the encoder graph now rebinds its cached ggml runners to the current thread, and a fail-closed guard turns any remaining stale-backend case into a typed per-session error instead of a process abort
- `pull`: model-pack downloads no longer silently fail after 30s on large packs -- a stall-detection duration was being applied as reqwest's total request timeout (which defaults to 30s if unset), killing any download whose wall-clock time exceeded that regardless of active progress; GPU backend-library pack downloads also gained the same retry/resume/stall-guard machinery the model-pack path already had, so a single network hiccup no longer fails the whole ~150 MB pack permanently
- Safetensors package-import parser (shared across 14+ model families): hardened against a crafted header driving an unbounded allocation, duplicate JSON keys, out-of-range/overlapping tensor offsets, and shape x dtype size mismatches, bringing it to parity with the already-hardened Whisper local-source parser; Whisper's package importer now reads through this shared hardened parser instead of a duplicated private copy
- Realtime streaming: terminal punctuation is no longer emitted at soft (mid-utterance) streaming boundaries, which previously left a stray sentence-ending mark mid-utterance in live captions
- `openasr live` now resolves catalog-only model aliases (e.g. `qwen:q8`) the same way `transcribe` does, instead of reporting an already-installed pack as "not installed"
- f32-to-f16 weight quantization: converged 12 divergent implementations (one of which did not round at all) onto a single round-to-nearest-even routine, fixing inconsistent bit-level quantization of the same source weight depending on which model family imported it (`wav2vec2_ctc` is the one family whose output bit pattern changes as a result)
