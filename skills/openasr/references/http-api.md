# OpenASR local HTTP API reference

Verified against `openasr serve` (core 0.1.11+). Everything here is local:
the server never downloads models, never phones home, and fails closed on
anything it cannot execute.

## Starting the server

```bash
openasr serve                          # 127.0.0.1:8080, installed default pack
openasr serve --model <installed-id>   # pick one installed pack by id
openasr serve --model-pack /path/to/model.oasr   # explicit local pack file
```

One model per server process; restart to switch. A fresh install with no
models still starts (health works) but transcription requests fail closed
until a pack is installed (`openasr pull <id>`). `--model` accepts bare or
quant-pinned ids (`whisper-tiny`, `whisper-tiny:q8`); it must name the same
pack that is being served.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health` -- liveness + server identity; never requires auth.
  `{"status","server_version","pid","instance_token","model_installed",
  "model_resident"}`. `model_installed` is whether a pack is bound at all;
  `model_resident` (0.1.13+) is whether that pack's runtime is currently
  loaded in memory -- `false` means the next transcription request pays a
  cold rebuild (idle-unloaded past the `idle_unload` threshold, or not yet
  loaded this boot), not an error.
- `GET /v1/models` -- OpenAI-style list of the served pack
  (`{"object":"list","data":[{"id","object":"model","owned_by":"openasr"}]}`;
  no `created` field).
- `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` -- OpenAI-compatible transcription
  (multipart form).
- `POST /v1/audio/precise-timeline` -- OpenASR-native forced alignment
  (multipart form). Does not run ASR. Accepts source `file` plus exactly one
  of `transcript` (plain text) or `transcript_json` (timed verbose/json body).
  Optional: `language`, `word_timestamps` (default true), `execution_target`,
  `response_format` (`verbose_json` default; `json`/`text`/`srt`/`vtt`/`markdown`).
  SRT/VTT reuse the shared subtitle exporter. Missing Forced Aligner pack,
  unsupported language (tag `ja`/`jp`/`ko`/`kr` or hiragana/katakana/hangul
  in the text), empty normalized text, audio past the timestamp grid, a
  prompt past decoder context (`llm_max_positions`), or a degenerate
  alignment fail closed. Paired device tokens may call this compute route;
  it is not operator-only. The server never downloads the pack.
- `POST /v1/audio/translations` -- OpenAI-compatible X->English speech
  translation (non-streaming; model families without a translate task reject
  it explicitly).
- `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions/{id}/pause|resume|cancel` -- OpenASR
  extension: control an in-flight request that supplied a `transcription_id`
  form field.
- `GET /v1/devices` -- OpenASR extension (0.1.13+): read-only enumeration of
  this daemon's own ggml compute devices (`{"object":"devices",
  "default_execution_target","devices":[{"id","name","meta","kind","target",
  "effective_target","memory"?}]}`). Always includes `auto` and `cpu`; an
  `accelerated` entry (Metal/CUDA/Vulkan/HIP, per platform) is present only
  when the runtime detects one. `default_execution_target` is what `auto`
  resolves to on this daemon (`cpu` or `accelerated`). Not operator-gated --
  same local-auth layer as `/v1/models`. Intended for a UI's execution-target
  picker; reflects the daemon's own runtime, not a remote sidecar's.

## OpenAI parameter compatibility matrix

Behavior of each OpenAI `audio/transcriptions` request parameter:

| OpenAI parameter | OpenASR behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | Supported (multipart). Non-WAV containers need `ffmpeg` on the server's `PATH`. |
| `model` | Required. Must name the loaded pack (quant-tag tolerant, e.g. `whisper-tiny:q8` matches a bare `whisper-tiny` pack). Anything else is a 400 -- the server never downloads. |
| `language` | Supported as a language hint where the model family supports one. |
| `prompt` | Forwarded to the model; families without prompt support reject it with an explicit error instead of ignoring it. |
| `response_format` | `json` (default), `text`, `srt`, `vtt`, `verbose_json` supported; `markdown` is an OpenASR extension. `diarized_json` is not supported (use the `diarize=true` extension field and read per-segment `speaker`). |
| `timestamp_granularities[]` | `segment` (always present) and `word` supported; `word_aligned` is an OpenASR extension that requires the forced-aligner capability pack and fails closed when it is missing. Unlike OpenAI, `verbose_json` is not strictly required. |
| `stream` (form field) | Rejected with a 400 and an actionable message. OpenAI SDK `stream=True` cannot work because the SSE protocol is OpenASR's, not `transcript.text.*` events -- see "Streaming" below. |
| `temperature` | Accepted and ignored (decoding is deterministic greedy). |
| `include[]` (`logprobs`) | Accepted and ignored; no logprobs in responses. |
| `chunking_strategy` | Accepted and ignored; long-form segmentation is automatic and tunable via the OpenASR `segment_mode`/`vad_*` extension fields. |
| `known_speaker_names[]` / `known_speaker_references[]` | Accepted and ignored; use `diarize=true` (+ optional `speakers=N`) instead. |

## Response shapes

- `json`: `{"text", "segments":[{"start","end","text",...}]}` -- OpenAI's
  `json` plus a `segments` extension.
- `verbose_json`: language (English name, when reported), duration (last
  segment end, seconds), text, segments (`id`, `start`, `end`, `text`,
  `words` when word timing was requested, `speaker` / `speaker_label` /
  `speaker_profile_id` when diarizing), flattened top-level `words` when
  word timing was requested. When `return_speaker_embeddings=true`, also
  `speaker_embeddings` (label-to-vector map) and sibling
  `speaker_embedding_space`.
  Not produced: `task`, `usage`, and per-segment decoder internals
  (`seek`, `tokens`, `avg_logprob`, `compression_ratio`, `no_speech_prob`).
  Plain `json` never includes `speaker_embeddings` / `speaker_embedding_space`.
- `text`, `srt`, `vtt`: plain bodies, same as OpenAI. `markdown` (extension)
  renders a `# Transcript` document.

## Using the OpenAI SDK

Non-streaming calls work out of the box:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="unused")
with open("audio.wav", "rb") as f:
    result = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        model="<installed-model-id>",
        file=f,
        response_format="verbose_json",
        timestamp_granularities=["word"],
    )
print(result.text)
```

`api_key` can be any placeholder unless an API key was created (below). Do
not pass `stream=True` -- the server rejects it with a 400 explaining why.

## Errors

OpenAI-style envelope with every key clients expect:

```json
{"error": {"message": "...", "type": "invalid_request_error", "param": null, "code": null}}
```

Statuses: 400 (invalid/unsupported/fail-closed refusals, including
model-not-loaded), 401 (missing/bad API key when keys exist), 403
(`authorization_error` when a remote-compute device token requests
`return_speaker_embeddings`), 404, 409 (canceled), 413 (upload too large),
429/503 (busy), 507 (disk full).
Messages are self-describing; surface them verbatim.

## Streaming (OpenASR SSE, not OpenAI events)

`POST /v1/audio/transcriptions?stream=true` (query parameter, not form
field) returns `text/event-stream` with OpenASR realtime events (observed
one-shot sequence): `session.created`, `session.configured`,
`audio.input.started`, `segment_start`, `transcript.final`, `final`,
`segment_end`, `audio.input.stopped`, `session.closed`, `done` (or an
`error` event on failure). It does not
emit OpenAI `transcript.text.delta`/`transcript.text.done`, so OpenAI SDK
streaming clients cannot parse it; consume it with an SSE library instead.
`response_format=srt|vtt` is rejected for streaming. Live microphone/system
audio uses a WebSocket session instead of this one-shot SSE path.

## API keys and remote binds

Loopback needs no credential by default. To require one anyway:

```bash
openasr apikey create --name "my-agent"   # plaintext shown exactly once
```

Once any key exists, every request except `GET /health` needs
`Authorization: Bearer oasr_sk_...` (the OpenAI SDK sends this automatically
when the key is passed as `api_key`). `openasr apikey list` / `revoke`
manage keys; revoking the last key returns to the key-free default.

API keys are a loopback-only convenience: binding to a non-loopback address
always requires TLS + device pairing (`--tls-self-signed
--pairing-admin-token-env ...`); see the repo README's "Local HTTP API"
section.

## OpenASR extension fields

Multipart form fields beyond the OpenAI set (all optional, all validated --
unsupported combinations fail closed with explicit errors):

- `task` (`transcribe`|`translate`), `diarize`, `speakers`, `punctuate`
- `return_speaker_embeddings` (opt-in; requires `diarize=true` and
  `response_format=verbose_json`). Default requests omit embeddings.
  When set, `verbose_json` adds a WhisperX/Speakr-compatible
  `speaker_embeddings` map (`SPEAKER_00` -> vector) plus a sibling
  `speaker_embedding_space` object (`model_id`, `pack_fingerprint`,
  `dim`, `normalization: "l2"`). These are biometric-derived data and
  are returned only on an explicit request. A remote-compute device
  token requesting this field is rejected with HTTP 403
  `authorization_error`; operator and loopback clients are not
  restricted. Streaming (`?stream=true`) rejects the field with 400.
- `hotword`/`phrase_bias` (repeatable) + `hotword_boost`/`phrase_bias_boost`
- Long-form segmentation: `segment_mode` (`off|auto|fixed|energy|vad`),
  `chunk_seconds`, `segment_overlap_seconds`, `vad_threshold_db`,
  `vad_min_silence_ms`, `vad_padding_ms`, `min_segment_seconds`,
  `suppress_silent_slices`
- Runtime: `inference_threads`, `execution_target` (`auto|cpu|accelerated`)
- Control: `transcription_id` (enables pause/resume/cancel endpoints)
