</div>

No terminal needed. Install the app, drop in an audio file, and get your transcript — everything runs on your machine.

> This repository is the Apache-2.0 open core behind the desktop app: a Rust CLI, a local OpenAI-compatible HTTP API, and the ggml inference engine. The desktop app wraps the same engine in a native GUI — no hidden network calls.

## What it does

- **Transcribe audio files** — single files or entire folders, output as plain text, SRT/VTT subtitles, or JSON with word-level timestamps
- **Live captions** — real-time transcription from your microphone with streaming partial results
- **System audio capture** — caption meetings, lectures, and podcasts by recording what your computer plays
- **Speaker separation** — automatically label who said what
- **Translation** — transcribe and translate to English in one step
- **Local API** — OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint, works with existing SDKs

## Why OpenASR

**Private.** In the default local mode, audio stays on your machine. Remote compute is available only when you explicitly pair and enable it; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#local-first-security-notes). No telemetry, no silent uploads, and no silent network fallback. The engine either produces a real transcript or tells you why it can't.

**Broad.** 30 models across 16 families — Whisper, Qwen3-ASR, Parakeet, SenseVoice, FireRed, Dolphin, Moonshine, Granite Speech, Fun-ASR-Nano, and more. Pick the one that fits your language and workload. All run through one binary on CPU and Apple Metal.

**Open.** The engine is Apache-2.0. Each model pack ships under its own upstream license as recorded in the registry and pack metadata. Every model download is verified against a signed catalog before it runs.

## For developers

### CLI quickstart

```bash
# Option A: Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
brew install quintinshaw/tap/openasr

# Option B: one-line installer (macOS / Linux)
curl -fsSL https://dl.openasr.org/install.sh | sh

# Option C: grab a prebuilt binary from Releases
# https://github.com/QuintinShaw/openasr/releases

# Transcribe a file (first run offers to download a model — you confirm first)
openasr transcribe recording.wav

# Live mic captions
openasr live

# SRT subtitles with speaker labels
openasr transcribe meeting.wav -f srt --diarize

# Align an existing manuscript onto audio (SRT/VTT/JSON)
openasr align recording.wav --transcript script.txt -f srt -o recording.srt
```

See [Quickstart](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for a guided walkthrough, or run `openasr --help`.

### Local API

```bash
openasr serve

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F file=@audio.wav -F model=qwen3-asr-0.6b
```

Drop-in compatible with OpenAI SDKs (`base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"`) for transcription. Forced alignment of a user-supplied manuscript is OpenASR-native: `POST /v1/audio/precise-timeline` with `file` + `transcript` (not an OpenAI endpoint). Offline native requests are serial by default. Operators can set `--max-native-sessions-per-model N`; `N` is both the admission limit and, for eligible direct-GPU Cohere, Moonshine, Qwen, and Whisper jobs, the source for an internal batch width capped at 8. CPU, scheduler, adapter, realtime, FireRed-AED, and FireRed2 paths remain serial; translations follow the offline policy. See [Agent Integration](docs/AGENT_INTEGRATION.md) for API key setup and agent workflows.

### Docker

Published images track each core release on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/quintinshaw/openasr) (runtime binary +
model-registry metadata only; pull models at runtime into a volume mounted at
`/data`). They do not include `bench-suite` fixtures or committed baselines
under `perf/`; run `openasr bench-suite` from a git checkout. The HTTP server
never auto-downloads a pack — install one first:

```bash
docker pull quintinshaw/openasr:latest
docker run --rm -d --name openasr \
  -p 8080:8080 -v openasr-data:/data quintinshaw/openasr:latest
docker exec openasr openasr pull whisper-small --yes

# NVIDIA GPU (requires NVIDIA Container Toolkit; sm_75 / Turing+)
docker pull quintinshaw/openasr:cuda-latest
docker run --rm -d --name openasr-cuda --gpus all \
  -p 8080:8080 -v openasr-data:/data quintinshaw/openasr:cuda-latest
```

| Tag | Platforms | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latest`, `<version>`, `sha-<short>` | `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` | CPU |
| `cuda-latest`, `cuda-<version>`, `cuda-sha-<short>` | `linux/amd64` | CUDA 13.2 runtime; fail-closed if no GPU is visible |

Vulkan, ROCm, and musl builds ship as GitHub Release archives only (not as
images). Local source builds: `Dockerfile` / `Dockerfile.cuda` and
`compose.yaml`. Longer guide (tags, compose, networking):
[openasr.org/docs/docker](https://openasr.org/docs/docker/).

### Building from source

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/QuintinShaw/openasr.git
cd openasr
cargo build --release -p openasr-cli
```

Requires Rust (pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`), CMake, and a C/C++ toolchain. Full build setup and development workflow in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Models

30 models across 16 families, from tiny English-only models that run faster than real-time to large multilingual models covering 100+ languages. Browse them at [openasr.org/models](https://openasr.org/models/) or from the CLI:

```bash
openasr search            # browse available models
openasr pull whisper-small  # install one
```

Benchmarks from the committed performance baseline are in [Performance](perf/PERFORMANCE.md).

## License

[Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). See [NOTICE](NOTICE) for attribution.

The ggml inference backend is MIT-licensed. Each model pack's license is defined by its registry entry and pack metadata; packs may use Apache-2.0, MIT, CC-BY, FunASR, or other upstream terms. This is not an exhaustive license guarantee. See [ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md](ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md) for the projects and model authors OpenASR builds on.

## Trademarks and branding

The OpenASR name, logo, and official app icons are reserved. Apache-2.0 covers the code, not the brand. Third-party products may say **“Powered by OpenASR”** and must not use OpenASR as their primary product name or imply official endorsement. Official apps are published only by the project operators.
