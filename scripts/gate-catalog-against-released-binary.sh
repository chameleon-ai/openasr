# Fail-closed pre-deploy gate: proves that the latest published *stable* CLI
# release binary can still load and initialize a candidate catalog before
# that catalog ships to catalog.openasr.org.
#
# Background: catalog data (model-registry/catalog.public.json) and CLI
# binaries (release-binaries.yml) ship on independent cadences. A catalog
# edit that is fine for the binary being cut *right now* can still break an
# already-shipped, already-in-the-wild binary if it depends on a shape or
# constraint that binary doesn't know about -- and there is nothing else in
# this repo's CI that ever runs a *real released binary* against a *candidate*
# catalog to check for that. This script is that check.
#
# Method: download the latest stable CLI release's linux-x86_64 tarball,
# point it at the candidate catalog.json + catalog.signature.json pair via
# OPENASR_CATALOG_FILE + OPENASR_CATALOG_IDENTITY (the same mechanism the
# desktop client uses to load a bundled, production-signed catalog file under
# its real https:// identity -- see load_local_catalog_file_with_identity in
# crates/openasr-core/src/registry.rs), and run `openasr doctor` against a
# throwaway OPENASR_HOME. `doctor` loads the full model registry from that
# catalog and resolves the default model, so it fails closed (non-zero exit)
# on anything the running binary's catalog-loading/registry pipeline rejects.
#
# Fail-closed by design: any failure to obtain and run a *real* released
# binary (network error, missing asset, resolution ambiguity) blocks the
# catalog rather than silently skipping verification. A green gate proves the
# candidate catalog was actually exercised by a real binary; it never proves
# that vacuously.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gate-catalog-against-released-binary.sh <catalog.json> <catalog.signature.json>
#
# Env overrides (for local iteration / testing):
#   OPENASR_RELEASE_REPO     GitHub repo to pull the release from
#                            (default: QuintinShaw/openasr)
#   OPENASR_GATE_BINARY      Path to an already-extracted `openasr` binary to
#                            use instead of downloading one (skips the
#                            release-resolution/download steps entirely).
#   OPENASR_GATE_IDENTITY    Catalog identity to verify the candidate against
#                            (default: the production catalog_url,
#                            https://catalog.openasr.org/v1/catalog.json).
#
# Requires: `gh` authenticated with access to OPENASR_RELEASE_REPO (public
# repo, so the default GITHUB_TOKEN in Actions is sufficient), `tar`.
