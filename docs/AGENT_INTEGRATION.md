# Agent Integration

How to point a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or any other agent that can
run a shell / call a local HTTP API) at OpenASR. Two independent paths:

1. **Skill + CLI** -- the agent shells out to the `openasr` binary directly.
   This is the primary, recommended path: no server process, no network
   surface, works offline.
2. **Local OpenAI-compatible HTTP API** -- for agents/tools that only speak
   HTTP (or want a long-lived local daemon instead of spawning a process per
   request).

Both paths are local-first by default: no telemetry, no silent cloud fallback,
no implicit model download (see [SECURITY](../SECURITY.md) and the repo-root
"Product principles"). Remote compute is available only when explicitly paired
and enabled.

## 1. Skill (CLI) path

The published Skill lives at [`skills/openasr/SKILL.md`](../skills/openasr/SKILL.md)
and follows the [`vercel-labs/skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)
convention: any file host on GitHub is a valid registry entry, no separate
publishing step. Install it into a project with:

```bash
npx skills add QuintinShaw/openasr --skill openasr --agent claude-code
# or interactively: npx skills add QuintinShaw/openasr
```

This copies the whole skill directory -- `SKILL.md` plus
`references/http-api.md` -- into the agent's local skills directory (for
example `.claude/skills/openasr/` for Claude Code). Verified locally with
`npx skills add <path-to-checkout> --skill openasr --agent claude-code`,
which installs both files under `./.claude/skills/openasr/`. The Skill
teaches the agent the `openasr` CLI surface: `transcribe`, `align`, `live`,
`search`/`pull`/`list`, `serve`, and `apikey`, including expected output
shapes and common failure modes (missing model, `--offline` fail-closed,
non-WAV without `ffmpeg`); the reference file carries the full HTTP API
parameter matrix so it only enters the agent's context when needed
(progressive disclosure).

Prerequisite: the `openasr` binary must be on `PATH` (`cargo install
--path crates/openasr-cli` from a source checkout, or a released binary).
The Skill itself does not install OpenASR.

## 2. Local HTTP API path

```bash
openasr serve --addr 127.0.0.1:8080 --backend native \
  --model-pack /path/to/model.oasr --model your-runtime-model-id
```

`--addr` defaults to `127.0.0.1:8080` -- a fixed, predictable port on purpose,
so an agent (or a script) can hardcode the base URL instead of discovering it.
This is independent of the desktop app's sidecar, which negotiates its own
port via a local handshake file and is unaffected by this default.

### Native concurrency

`--max-native-sessions-per-model N` is the single server-side concurrency control
for a resolved native model. The default `N=1` is serial. For eligible offline
Cohere, Moonshine, Qwen, and Whisper direct-GPU requests, the server keeps the
admission permit through queueing and reply, and derives an internal width no
larger than `min(N, 8, runtime-safe width)`. Values above eight admit more work
but are processed in multiple batches. CPU, scheduler-backed, adapter, realtime,
FireRed-AED, and FireRed2 requests use serial execution; translations use the
same offline admission policy. Queue/full errors are retryable `429`; a stopped
or timed-out batch owner returns `503`.

### Loopback trust and API keys

Loopback (`127.0.0.1`) callers are trusted by default: no `Authorization`
header is required. That is deliberate for the common case (an agent running
on the same machine). If you want an explicit credential anyway -- for
example a shared dev box, or just to be strict about who can call the daemon
-- create a key:

```bash
openasr apikey create --name "claude-code-laptop"
# Created API key key_1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b (claude-code-laptop).
# This is the ONLY time the full key is shown -- store it now:
#
#   oasr_sk_<64 hex chars>
#
# Once any key exists, `openasr serve` requires it (Authorization: Bearer <key>)
# even on 127.0.0.1. Run `openasr apikey revoke key_1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b` to remove it.
```

Only a SHA-256 hash of the key is ever written to disk
(`~/.openasr/apikeys.json`, permissions `0600`); the plaintext is shown
exactly once, at creation, and cannot be recovered afterward. From that point
on, every loopback request to `serve` -- including `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
-- must carry `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, or it gets `401`. `GET /health`
stays unauthenticated (used for liveness probes).

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer oasr_sk_<...>" \
  -F file=@audio.wav \
  -F model=your-runtime-model-id \
  -F response_format=verbose_json
```

Manage keys with:

```bash
openasr apikey list      # id, name, created-at, key preview (never the full key)
openasr apikey revoke key_1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b
```

Revoking the last remaining key returns loopback `serve` to its key-free
default.

API keys apply to **manually-launched** `openasr serve` only. The desktop
app's supervisor-managed daemon (identified by the instance-token environment
variable the supervisor sets when spawning it) is exempt: its UI talks to it
over loopback without bearer headers, and its remote access is secured by
TLS + pairing instead -- so creating a key never locks the desktop app out
of its own daemon.

### What API keys do not change

A locally-created API key is a **loopback-only** convenience. Binding `serve`
to a non-loopback address (remote/network access) still requires HTTPS/WSS
and device pairing exactly as before (`--tls-self-signed
--pairing-admin-token-env ...`); an API key never substitutes for that, and
non-loopback binds ignore any configured keys entirely. See the "Non-loopback
binds" section of the root [README](../README.md#local-http-api) for the
remote-serving flow.

### Endpoints an agent typically needs

- `GET /health` -- liveness + server identity, unauthenticated. Includes
  `model_installed` (a pack is bound) and `model_resident` (0.1.13+: that
  pack's runtime is currently loaded in memory, vs. idle-unloaded or not yet
  loaded this boot).
- `GET /v1/models` -- installed packs.
- `GET /v1/devices` -- OpenASR extension (0.1.13+): read-only enumeration of
  this daemon's own ggml compute devices (always `auto` + `cpu`, plus an
  `accelerated` entry when the runtime detects a GPU) and
  `default_execution_target` (what `auto` resolves to here). Not
  operator-gated.
- `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` -- OpenAI-compatible transcription
  (multipart `file` + `model`; `response_format` of `json`, `text`, `srt`,
  `vtt`, `verbose_json`, or `markdown`).
- `POST /v1/audio/translations` -- OpenAI-compatible X->English translation
  (non-streaming; families without a translate task reject it explicitly).

### OpenAI SDK compatibility

Official OpenAI SDKs work against `serve` out of the box for non-streaming
calls (`base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"`, any placeholder `api_key`,
or a real key once one exists). Errors use the OpenAI envelope
(`error.{message,type,param,code}`). `verbose_json` carries `language`,
`duration`, segment `id`s, and a top-level `words` array when word
timestamps are requested; it does not fabricate `task`, `usage`, or decoder
internals (`avg_logprob`, `no_speech_prob`, ...). OpenAI parameters with no
local equivalent (`temperature`, `include[]`, `chunking_strategy`,
`known_speaker_*`) are accepted and ignored. SDK `stream=True` (the `stream`
form field) is rejected with an actionable 400: SSE streaming is the
OpenASR realtime protocol behind the `?stream=true` query parameter, not
OpenAI `transcript.text.*` events. When that query-parameter stream is used
for a file job, a busy server returns HTTP 429 instead of joining the
cancelable JSON file FIFO; see [Known Limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

### Incomplete transcripts

A decode can end before it has described all of its audio -- the shared
degenerate-repeat guard cuts off a model that started looping, or the token
budget runs out before the model finishes. The request still succeeds; the
transcript is simply short. Both JSON formats therefore carry a top-level
`truncated` array (absent when the transcript covers its audio), and every
format sets the `x-openasr-truncated` response header:

```json
"truncated": [
  { "slice": 3, "reason": "degenerate-repeat-guard", "covers_up_to_seconds": 12.5 }
]
```

`reason` is `degenerate-repeat-guard` or `budget-exhausted`. `slice` is the
1-based long-form slice and is absent for a single-pass decode.
`covers_up_to_seconds` is absent for families that emit no intra-decode
timestamps -- there is no honest value, and the clip length would read as
"nothing was lost". Treat the presence of an entry, not its anchor, as the
signal. The CLI prints the same fact as a `warning:` line on stderr, so it
is visible for `text`/`srt`/`vtt`/`markdown` output too.

The full parameter-by-parameter matrix lives in the Skill's
[`references/http-api.md`](../skills/openasr/references/http-api.md); the
root [README](../README.md#local-http-api) documents the request-field
reference (longform/segment options, phrase-bias/hotword fields,
streaming).
