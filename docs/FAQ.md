# OpenASR FAQ

This FAQ answers current behavior questions. Source-of-truth status is
[Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) (see its Implemented-baseline section).

## What is OpenASR?

OpenASR is a local-first ASR runner with a Rust CLI, a local server, a model
metadata registry, and a transcription-focused OpenAI-compatible API subset. It
runs native ggml-backed model packs offline.

## What native model families run today?

Sixteen, dispatched by a data-driven architecture registry (`arch/`): Whisper,
Cohere Transcribe, Qwen3-ASR, Parakeet-CTC, Parakeet-TDT (25 European
languages), wav2vec2-CTC (incl. data2vec), Moonshine, Dolphin (Chinese
dialects), SenseVoice (zh/yue/en/ja/ko), MiMo-V2.5-ASR (zh/en/yue; RVQ
tokenizer + Qwen2 decoder), FireRedASR-AED (Mandarin + English bilingual),
FireRedASR2-LLM (Mandarin + English bilingual; Encoder-Adapter-LLM),
Fun-ASR-Nano (zh/en; SAN-M encoder + Qwen3 decoder), Granite Speech 4.1
(en/fr/de/es/pt/ja; Conformer + Q-Former + 2B decoder),
MOSS-Transcribe-Diarize (zh/en meeting transcription with in-decoder speaker
segmentation), and X-ASR (Zipformer). They run local offline transcription on CPU and Metal
lanes. See [Known Limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for per-family
streaming and word-timestamp support, and the per-model cards under
[`model-registry/models/`](../model-registry/models/) for quant tiers.

## What backends are active right now?

- `native` (default): local `.oasr` pack execution with staged fail-closed
  boundaries.
- `mock`: deterministic local mock transcription, opt-in via `--backend mock`
  (hidden in `--help`) for plumbing and CI.

## Does OpenASR download models automatically?

Never silently. `openasr pull` is the explicit command for published packs. In
addition, `transcribe`/`live` will install a missing model for you, but **only
through a visible consent prompt** (showing model, quant, size, host, and
license); `--offline` or any non-interactive run fails closed before touching the
network. The shared resolve path and the HTTP server never pull -- the server
runs only an explicit local pack.

## Can I download models for local experiments?

Yes. For published packs, use `openasr pull <id>:<quant>` or a bare `<id>` for
the recommended quant. For unpublished local development/benchmark workflows,
stage artifacts under `./tmp/` with provenance recorded (source identity,
revision/path, SHA256, size, mirror endpoint if used). Do not commit downloaded
artifacts.

## What pack format does the runtime accept?

Only `.oasr` (GGUF-backed internally). The bare `.gguf` extension is no longer
accepted as CLI run input or importer output. See
[Format Contract](format/OASR_PACKAGE_CONTRACT_V1.md).

## How do I build a pack?

Use the per-family importer on a local HF-style source directory:
`import whisper`, `import qwen`, `import cohere`,
`import parakeet-ctc`, `import parakeet-tdt`, `import wav2vec2-ctc`,
`import moonshine`, `import dolphin`, `import sensevoice`. Each accepts
`--quantization fp16|q8_0|q4_k`
(Qwen adds `q3_k`). `openasr pull` installs already-published packs; it does not
replace local importer workflows. There is no `quantize` command.

## Can I validate or inspect a local pack?

Yes. `openasr verify <path.oasr>` and `openasr show <path.oasr>` probe a
caller-provided local `.oasr` file via ggml. They reject remote URLs, missing
paths, and directory paths, and
do not run inference.

## Can I align an existing transcript onto audio?

Yes. `openasr align audio.wav --transcript script.txt -f srt` force-aligns a
plain-text manuscript onto the audio with the Qwen3-ForcedAligner pack (no ASR).
The HTTP equivalent is `POST /v1/audio/precise-timeline` with `file` +
`transcript`. Japanese and Korean fail closed by language tag (`ja`/`ko`)
or by kana/hangul script. Pure-kanji Japanese cannot be identified as
Japanese: tagged `ja` it is 400; tagged `en` it follows the CJK character
tokenizer. A missing pack, empty normalized text, a prompt past decoder
context, or a degenerate timeline is an error rather than a fabricated SRT.
See [Known Limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for normalization rules, the
400 s timestamp-grid ceiling, and the decoder-context admission.

## Can I transcribe with a local native pack?

Yes. `openasr transcribe <audio>` uses the native backend by default and runs an
installed model (offering to install the default model on first use). To pin an
exact local pack instead, pass `--model-pack <local.oasr>`: the path must be a
local regular `.oasr` file; remote URLs/downloads are rejected. Current scope is
offline/final-only and fail-closed by stage.

## What is the staged fail-closed contract on native?

Execution is split into separate stages so failures are unambiguous rather than
a single opaque "native failed": runtime-pack path → metadata → tensor index →
encoder tensor binding/materialization → encoder graph → tokenizer load →
decoder tensor binding/materialization → decoder graph → greedy decode →
decode text.

## Is realtime true streaming ASR available?

For runtime packs that declare the streaming feature and whose family has a
registered streaming executor (e.g. X-ASR/Zipformer, Qwen3-ASR, Whisper),
native frame-synchronous streaming emits incremental partials. Packs without that
metadata fall back to final-per-utterance output. Official published streaming
packs and public product guarantees are still pending — see
[Known Limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

## Is diarization available?

Yes. For local file transcription, `--diarize` (and the API `diarize` flag)
enables the complete Voice ID path: first determine who spoke when, then match
enough clean evidence against the local person library. The speaker source is
selected by the ASR architecture rather than by a model-id allowlist:

- `moss-transcribe-diarize` supplies recording-local speaker turns from its own
  decoder.
- Every other ASR family uses the shared recording-level pipeline: FireRed
  Stream-VAD, a speaker segmenter, speaker embeddings, automatic AHC/spectral
  clustering, and overlap-aware reconstruction.

The default speaker embedder is ReDimNet2-B6 (192-d). An explicit
`voice_id_embedder=wespeaker` preference (or `OPENASR_WESPEAKER_PACK`) loads the
optional WeSpeaker ResNet family (256-d, VoxCeleb English LM, sizes 34/152/221/293)
instead. There is no Auto "use whatever is installed": a selected WeSpeaker pack
that is missing or broken fails closed rather than falling back to ReDimNet.
ReDimNet and WeSpeaker occupy different identity spaces, so enrollments do not transfer.
Default diarization capability still requires the ReDimNet2-B6 pack. MOSS removes the external
segmentation/clustering step, not the acoustic identity step. Missing or
broken required packs fail closed instead of fabricating speakers or silently
changing embedding space.

segmentation-3.0 is the permissive default external segmenter. DiariZen
Large-s80-md-v2 is a higher-accuracy optional provider whose checkpoint is CC
BY-NC 4.0. Its published pack is fp16-only and requires explicit
non-commercial license acceptance before download plus a separate activation
choice. Enabling Voice ID alone still prepares segmentation-3.0; it never
silently installs DiariZen.

The operator-only `/v1/voice-id/*` API
(`crates/openasr-server/src/routes/voice_id.rs`) manages people and samples,
consent revocation, and metadata export. Enrolling a person requires at least
10 seconds of clean speech per registered sample
(`MIN_SAMPLE_SPEECH_SECONDS`,
`crates/openasr-core/src/diarize/voice_id/quality.rs`); once a person is
enrolled, automatically naming an anonymous `SPEAKER_NN` label to that person
during diarization additionally needs at least 8 continuous seconds of that
person speaking uninterrupted in one turn to clear naming's evidence gate
(`MIN_CONTINUOUS_SPEECH_SECONDS_FOR_NAMING`,
`crates/openasr-core/src/diarize/voice_id/identity.rs`). A speaker who is not
enrolled, or whose evidence falls short of that gate, simply keeps a
session-relative `SPEAKER_NN` number -- Voice ID never fabricates an identity
match.

This universal identity contract is qualified for local file transcription.
Realtime and remote-compute diarization use separate API and privacy contracts;
their lower-level speaker fields do not establish the same cross-recording
identity guarantee. Per-speaker embedding vectors are omitted from
transcription responses unless `return_speaker_embeddings=true` is set
(verbose_json only); a remote-compute device token requesting them is
rejected.

OpenASR does not perform source/audio separation (isolating vocals from
background music or noise, the way Demucs or similar stem-splitting tools do).
Diarization and Voice ID only label, and optionally name, existing speech
segments within a single mixed audio stream; there is no implementation of, or
plan for, stem separation.

## Does the server keep the model resident in RAM forever?

No. By default the daemon releases the bound model's resident runtime (mmap,
tensors, Metal state) after 10 minutes with no active transcription request or
realtime session; the next request just reloads and re-warms it, paying the
normal cold-build cost again. Adjust or disable this via the `idle_unload`
preference (`never`, `now`, `2m`, `10m` (default), `1h`).

## Is OpenASR public/open source now?

Yes. OpenASR is licensed under Apache-2.0 and maintained as the public open core.
Model packs are distributed separately under their own upstream licenses. See
[Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Are official installers/releases available?

Yes for the open-core CLI and local server. Each core release publishes
checksummed archives on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/QuintinShaw/openasr/releases) (macOS,
Linux, Windows, plus CUDA/ROCm/Vulkan/musl variants where applicable) and
matching runtime images on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/quintinshaw/openasr) (`latest` /
`<version>` for CPU multi-arch, `cuda-latest` / `cuda-<version>` for CUDA
amd64). The separate macOS/Windows desktop apps ship from
[openasr.org/download](https://openasr.org/download/).

## Is there an official Docker image?

Yes. `quintinshaw/openasr` on Docker Hub. Images contain the release binary and
model-registry metadata only — mount a volume at `/data`, then
`docker exec … openasr pull <model> --yes` before calling the HTTP API. The
server never auto-pulls. They do not ship `perf/` bench-suite fixtures or
baselines, so `openasr bench-suite` inside the container will fail looking for
those files; run benchmarks from a git checkout. CUDA tags require the NVIDIA
Container Toolkit and refuse to start if no GPU is visible. Longer guide:
[openasr.org/docs/docker](https://openasr.org/docs/docker/).

## Is ffmpeg required?

Not for current mock and native paths. OpenASR does not bundle/install/manage
ffmpeg.

## Is the API fully OpenAI-compatible?

No. OpenASR implements a focused local transcription subset plus local realtime
routes. See [Known Limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

## How are performance checks run?

Via the committed `bench-suite` (`perf/suite.toml`), which records RTF and peak
RSS per entry under subprocess isolation and gates against committed baselines
(`gate_peak_rss`, `gate_vs_cpp`), including competitive comparison vs
whisper.cpp. See [Performance](../perf/PERFORMANCE.md).
