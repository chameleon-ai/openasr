# Docs Index

Source-of-truth map for active OpenASR documentation. Implementation truth and
sequencing live in [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) (see its Implemented-baseline section).

The repo-root [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md) is the fast code map for new
contributors -- crate relationships, the audio-to-transcript pipeline, and the
`arch/` + `models/` per-family layout convention. The tables below map `docs/`.

## Top-level docs (`docs/`)

| Doc | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) | Implementation truth, sequencing, and active priorities; the Implemented-baseline section records what runs today (active `mock`/`native` backends, the eight native model families, the `arch/` registry, the `.oasr`-only pack contract) and what is deferred. OpenASR is Apache-2.0 open core. |
| [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) | Three commands to a real transcript: build, transcribe (native by default, consent-pull on first run), and pick a model. |
| [Model Onboarding](MODEL_ONBOARDING.md) | Contributor checklist for adding or migrating a family: one descriptor inventory row, a narrow adapter, shared compute/runtime seams, pack proof, conformance gates, and the explicit core-only/staged/public-ready release handoff. |
| [Model Release Audits](model-audits/README.md) | Per-family release audit forms (`model-audits/<family>.md`, from `model-audits/TEMPLATE.md`): ten performance/completeness dimensions, three-state status with mandatory justifications, enforced fail-closed by the publish pipeline before a family goes `public:true`. |
| [Model Catalog, Registry, and Distribution](MODEL_CATALOG_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Catalog ownership chain (human-edited publishing catalog -> generated `model-registry/catalog.json`), `openasr pull` install mechanics, the local `model-registry/models/*.toml` cards, signed catalog hosting/cache, and the no-implicit-download boundary. |
| [Catalog Forward Compatibility and Client Resilience](CATALOG_COMPATIBILITY.md) | What a running build must do with a catalog from a different epoch: fail-closed boundary (signature/epoch rollback/schema-major/required fields) vs. must-tolerate degradation (unknown language codes, unknown kind/license_class/capability role -> hide the entry, not the catalog); the epoch floor's narrower boot-local-candidate exception; the verify-then-persist + cache/embedded fallback chain; the `catalog_degraded` status surface (`doctor`, `/health`); and the 2026-07-16 cache-pollution incident this hardens against. |
| [Known Limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) | Current user-visible limits: `.oasr`-only native packs, streaming guarantees, local-file-only universal Voice ID, explicitly consented non-commercial DiariZen Large-s80-md-v2, generic accelerator selection, and qualification-only benchmarks. |
| [FAQ](FAQ.md) | Current-behavior questions: what OpenASR is, which families run, which backends are active, and the conservative offline transcription lane. |
| [Releasing](../RELEASING.md) | Manual core release: the single workspace version, `scripts/bump-version.sh` (pin only), `workflow_dispatch` on `release-core.yml`, and post-publication Docker/Homebrew via `publish-core-channels.yml`. |
| [Agent Integration](AGENT_INTEGRATION.md) | How a coding agent uses OpenASR: the `skills/openasr` Skill (CLI path) and the local OpenAI-compatible HTTP API, including `openasr apikey` for opt-in loopback authentication. |
| [Default Model Resolution](default-model-resolution.md) | The single-authority `default_selection` resolver (fail-closed, `config.json` + `default.json` pointer, three-state result) that the server, CLI, and any future shell must all read/write through -- no second resolver, no fabricated defaults. |

User-facing Docker install/run guide (tags, GPU, volumes, pull-before-serve):
[openasr.org/docs/docker](https://openasr.org/docs/docker/). The short form lives
in the root [README](../README.md#docker).

## Format contracts (`docs/format/`)

| Doc | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [OASR Package Contract v1](format/OASR_PACKAGE_CONTRACT_V1.md) | Normative `.oasr` distribution contract: v1 payload is standard GGUF bytes; separates the extension-agnostic container probe from the user-facing extension check; runtime/backend selection is metadata-driven, not free-form string parsing. |

## Design docs (`docs/design/`)

| Doc | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Model-family lifecycle](design/model-family-lifecycle.md) | Normative v2 lifecycle: required descriptor facets, the PackCandidate -> VerifiedPack -> AdmittedPack proof chain, Optimization A/B/C, generated projections, compute-layer boundary, reference migration order, and cleanup gates. |
| [Model Onboarding Contract](design/model-onboarding-contract.md) | Reviewer-facing anti-fragmentation contract for new ASR-architecture PRs: the shared registration/decode/packaging/tokenizer/`nn/`/capabilities/progress facilities every family must reuse instead of re-implementing, plus a PR checklist. Written after the FireRedASR-AED long-audio repetition bug (issue #60) showed the cost of a family bypassing the shared decode driver. |
| [Decoder State and Native Memory Planning](design/decoder-state-memory-planning.md) | Four-layer contract for family token topology, native backend physical-footprint quotes, process-wide atomic memory admission, and semantics-preserving execution fallback. Includes the 30/60-second product envelope and decoder-family onboarding checklist. |
| [Short-audio receipt](design/short-audio-receipt.md) | Machine-readable `openasr.short-audio-receipt.v0` short-audio gate binding core commit, pack/audio digests, backend/device/OS, transcript, and optional wall-clock RTF. |
| [Runtime Source Preflight and Provenance](design/runtime-source-preflight.md) | One-open/one-preflight construction contract for GGUF metadata, tensor indexes, readers, native weight contexts, content-keyed caches, and new-family anti-bypass gates. |

For model-family changes, the lifecycle row above is the top-level entry point;
the onboarding and reviewer contract are its implementation and review views.

## Speaker diarization

| Doc | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Diarization Pack Publishing](DIARIZATION_PACK_PUBLISHING.md) | Universal file Voice ID topology; published ReDimNet2-B6/segmentation-3.0 packs; and the explicitly consented non-commercial DiariZen Large-s80-md-v2 path. |
| [VBx PLDA Resegmentation](VBX_PLDA_RESEGMENTATION.md) | The PLDA-mixture / HMM VBx resegmentation refinement for diarization. |

The diarization privacy model and surface-specific identity/redaction contract
(anonymous labels by default and explicit local enrollment) live in
[`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## Build & platform

| Doc | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [GPU Plugin Build](GPU_PLUGIN_BUILD.md) | Building the optional GPU backend plugin packs (Vulkan / HIP / CUDA). |
| [Android Build](ANDROID_BUILD.md) | Android (aarch64) cross-compilation. |
| [iOS / macOS SDK](SDK_IOS_MACOS.md) | `crates/openasr-ffi`'s C ABI and `OpenASR.xcframework`: build, C API, Swift bridging sketch, CPU-only v1 posture. |

## Brand & distribution (repo root)

| Doc | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Trademarks](../TRADEMARKS.md) | OpenASR name, logo, and official app icon reservation; allowed "Powered by OpenASR"; no implied endorsement. |
| [Branding](../BRANDING.md) | Practical checklist: independent product name, UI, store listing, and support for third-party apps. |
| [xcframework distribution](../XCFRAMEWORK-DISTRIBUTION.md) | Shipping App Store / Mac apps that embed `OpenASR.xcframework` without passing as the official app. |

## Notes

- The user-facing quantization path is import-time tier selection (`fp16` /
  `q8_0` / `q4_k`, plus `q3_k` for Qwen). The earlier offline mixed-quant
  research lane (OMIX / quant-policy / quant-tier docs + `scripts/quant_*`) was
  removed; rewrite from scratch if revived.
- Performance harness, regression gates, and competitive comparisons are
  documented in [`../perf/PERFORMANCE.md`](../perf/PERFORMANCE.md); helper scripts
  are described in [`../scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md).
