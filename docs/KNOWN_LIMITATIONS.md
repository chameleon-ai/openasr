# Known Limitations

This page lists current user-visible limits. For implementation truth and
sequencing, see [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) (Implemented-baseline section).

## Current limitations

- OpenASR publishes binary archives and SHA-256 checksums for macOS, Linux, and
  Windows on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/QuintinShaw/openasr/releases).
  There are no package-manager channels yet; building from source remains
  supported. Public model-pack distribution is limited to catalog entries
  explicitly marked `public:true`.
- The only executable backends are the default `native` and the opt-in `mock`
  stub. Native transcription runs offline from `.oasr` runtime packs -- a pinned
  `--model-pack`, an installed pack, or one the CLI installs on first use through
  a visible consent prompt -- and stays fail-closed by stage.
- The consent-gated CLI pull, the no-silent-download boundary, and pull/install
  mechanics are centralized in [Model Catalog, Registry, and Distribution](MODEL_CATALOG_ARCHITECTURE.md);
  the HTTP server never pulls.
- Realtime cadence is descriptor-driven: any pack whose family has a registered
  streaming executor gets live partials, and every built-in ASR family
  (Qwen3-ASR, Whisper, Cohere Transcribe, Moonshine, Parakeet-CTC, wav2vec2-CTC,
  SenseVoice, Dolphin, and X-ASR) registers one -- a startup completeness gate
  rejects any family that does not. X-ASR is frame-sync-append (append-only
  partials); ChatML utterance LLMs (FunASR-Nano, FireRed-LLM, MiMo-ASR, MOSS)
  are utterance-complete snapshots (incomplete windows may be empty; partials
  may use a short endpoint-silence hint); every other family is a revisable
  snapshot (incomplete windows should produce text, FINAL is byte-identical to
  offline). Official published packs with public product
  guarantees are still pending.
- Universal Voice ID is currently a local **file-transcription** feature. MOSS
  supplies its own speaker turns; all other ASR families use FireRed Stream-VAD,
  a speaker segmenter, a speaker embedder, automatic clustering, and
  overlap-aware reconstruction. Both paths reuse the shared identity/evidence
  stage. The default embedder is ReDimNet2-B6, and the default capability probe
  still requires that pack. An explicit `voice_id_embedder=wespeaker` preference
  (or `OPENASR_WESPEAKER_PACK`) loads the optional WeSpeaker ResNet family
  (256-d, VoxCeleb English LM, sizes 34/152/221/293) instead; there is no Auto
  fallback, and ReDimNet and WeSpeaker occupy different identity spaces so enrollments
  do not transfer. Missing or broken required or selected packs fail closed.
  This universal contract is qualified for local file transcription; realtime
  and remote-compute diarization remain separate surfaces with their own output
  and privacy gates.
  Labels stay session-relative (`SPEAKER_00/01`, ...) unless an enrolled person
  clears Voice ID's evidence gates. See [FAQ.md](FAQ.md#is-diarization-available)
  and [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
- segmentation-3.0 is the default, MIT-licensed external segmenter. DiariZen
  Large-s80-md-v2 is a published optional CC BY-NC 4.0 provider and remains
  fp16-only. Download and activation require explicit non-commercial license
  acknowledgement; merely enabling Voice ID does not install it. Its
  locked six-file F32/Python reference measured 8.1274% DER, and reconstructing
  the qualified mixed-precision pack in the same adapter measured 8.1232%, with
  no material precision loss. The native OpenASR path measured 7.9491% DER
  (3.8806% miss, 1.1348% false alarm, 2.9336% speaker error) under the same
  duration-weighted protocol (0.25 s collar, overlap scored); all six recordings
  beat MOSS, whose aggregate was 18.6787%. That native aggregate transparently
  combines A1-M2 from one process with an identical-runtime M3 supplement after
  the external test harness output pipe failed before M3 started; it is not a
  claim of one uninterrupted six-file process. The historical Base-s80 F32
  reference was 9.0481%, and the segmentation-3.0 research adapter was 12.4466%.
  These fixed Mandarin meeting-slice results qualify the published
  implementation, not a cross-domain guarantee or cross-recording Voice ID
  enrollment/unknown-rejection guarantee; the AISHELL excerpts still
  underestimate speaker count.
- Phrase bias / hotword boosting is implemented for the native runtime decode
  path. Requests still fail closed when the selected model tokenizer cannot
  encode a requested phrase, and the mock backend still rejects non-empty
  phrase-bias requests. Most families apply phrase bias as a per-token logit
  boost during decoding; Dolphin instead runs its upstream-trained native
  deep-biasing context module (`context_module.*`: a BiLSTM context encoder +
  cross-attention fusion into the encoder output ahead of attention rescoring,
  arXiv:2305.12493) and therefore has no per-phrase `boost` weight to apply --
  the phrase *list* is the only signal it honors, and CTC prefix-beam n-best
  generation still runs over the un-biased encoder output (only the
  attention-rescoring decoder input is biased), matching the upstream
  reference decode.
- Word-level timestamp requests are accepted and exported in JSON/VTT. Whisper
  uses native decoder cross-attention frame probabilities and the CTC families
  (parakeet-ctc, wav2vec2-ctc) use decoder frame spans; Qwen, Cohere, and
  Moonshine fall back to decoder token-position estimates because those runtimes
  do not expose acoustic attention, so their word timings are approximate.
  Dolphin does not emit word-level timestamps at all -- its CTC/attention joint
  decode only returns a single segment-level span, so `--word-timestamps`
  requests against a Dolphin pack yield an empty word list rather than an error.
  SenseVoice likewise returns an empty word list: its CTC frames sit on a 60 ms
  low-frame-rate grid behind 4 prompt frames, so per-word times would be
  fabricated precision rather than acoustic timestamps. FireRedASR-AED,
  FireRed2-LLM, FunASR-Nano, MiMo-ASR, Granite Speech, and MOSS likewise return
  empty word lists: those executors expose no usable word-alignment head. The
  signed catalog records this as `word_timestamp_source = "forced_aligner"`;
  families that populate word anchors declare `native`.
- Word-timestamp refinement (`--word-timestamps=aligned` / API
  `timestamp_granularities=word_aligned`) is an opt-in tier on top of the
  approximate timestamps above: it re-runs the finished transcript and the full
  source audio through the Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B capability pack and
  replaces each segment's word spans with the aligner's own output. Passing
  `=aligned` is explicit consent to install the pack. File Voice ID also
  requires this pack automatically for an external ASR whose catalog
  `word_timestamp_source` is `forced_aligner`: Desktop/CLI preflight the
  dependency, while the server remains operator-gated and never downloads.
  At runtime the aligner only executes when the decoded transcript actually
  contains a coarse segment crossing multiple speaker turns. It runs before
  speaker attribution, so its anchors are used to split text exactly; the
  internally requested word list is stripped again unless the caller asked
  for word timestamps. It is native-backend-only and does not
  yet support Japanese or Korean transcripts -- the reference routes those
  through external morphological segmenters (`nagisa`/`soynlp`) that have not
  been ported, so an `aligned` request against ja/ko text fails closed with a
  typed error rather than mis-tokenizing. Other families keep their approximate
  timestamps unchanged. Explicit `aligned` only refines words; the automatic
  Voice ID path additionally consumes those words to assign each text run to
  the canonical speaker timeline.
- External manuscript alignment (`openasr align` / `POST /v1/audio/precise-timeline`
  with `transcript=`) reuses the same Forced Aligner pack and tokenizer. The
  returned `text` keeps the caller's punctuation and casing. Internally the
  aligner: splits on ASCII whitespace; keeps letters, numbers, and apostrophes;
  strips other punctuation; treats each CJK ideograph as its own token; defaults
  omitted/`auto` language to `en`. Japanese and Korean fail closed by language
  tag (`ja`/`jp`/`jpn`/`ko`/`kr`/`kor`) and by script (hiragana, katakana,
  hangul) even when the hint is `en`. Audio longer than the classify-head grid
  (5000 × 80 ms = 400 s for the shipped pack) fails closed rather than wrapping
  timestamps. A prompt that would exceed decoder context (`llm_max_positions`,
  8192 in the shipped pack) also fails closed before the encoder/prefill graphs
  are built — the 400 s grid is not a substitute for that budget. A collapsed or
  zero-duration timeline is treated as a severe transcript/audio mismatch;
  pauses longer than 4 s in a correctly aligned manuscript are not. The server
  never downloads the pack; paired device tokens may call the endpoint (it is a
  compute route, not operator-only). This route is not yet on the file
  FIFO / pause / cancel surface used by `/v1/audio/transcriptions`; a request
  that has entered alignment cannot be cancelled that way. The plain-transcript
  path still aligns the whole recording as one Forced Aligner item: it does
  not auto-split. Inputs that would exceed decoder context or the 400 s grid
  fail closed instead of being chunked. Kanji-only Japanese with no kana, when
  tagged `en`/`auto`, still takes the CJK character path and is not caught by
  the hiragana/katakana/hangul script guard. CLI `align`
  is itself consent to install the pack unless `--offline`.
- Hardware execution target selection is generic: Desktop/server requests support
  `auto`, `cpu`, and `accelerated` when the native runtime reports an accelerated
  device. There is no public per-provider/per-device pinning surface such as
  `gpu0`. Internally the runtime can resolve a concrete execution route
  (`provider` + ggml stable device name + optional PCI `device_id` from CUDA/HIP,
  and from Vulkan when available). What is route-isolated today:
  - thread-local ggml **backend-handle** cache (Exact pin never shares a handle;
    preferred/Auto may Optimus-fall through discrete -> iGPU but always caches
    under the device that actually initialized)
  - streaming **worker** keys
  - device-owning family runtime actor pools: `(PackContentKey, ExecutionLaneKey)`
    (plus adapter fingerprint where applicable); the content key comes from the
    already-open source, so same-path replacement misses
  - serve-batch engine keys (build identity + `ExecutionLaneKey` + family
    capacity geometry)
  What is intentionally **not** partitioned by route:
  - host-neutral prepared data is content-keyed only; its type contract forbids
    backend handles, device buffers, schedulers, graphs, or uploaded arenas
  - **admission capacity stays per model identity** (CPU and accelerated share one
    slot for the same model; route does not multiply capacity)
  Exact device pins are fail-closed: missing devices, init failures, Metal
  (still `MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice` only), and CPU StableId Exact return typed
  not-found / not-addressable / init-failed errors instead of silently swapping
  cards or falling back to CPU. Unavailable coarse `accelerated` targets still
  fail closed. Physical PCI keys are normalized (trim + lower-case) only; full
  BDF grammar validation is a follow-up.
- On Windows ReBAR discrete GPUs, Vulkan Peak Working Set can exceed the HIP
  and CPU figures even when DeviceLocal buffers are not mapped. ReBAR types
  are DeviceLocal|HostVisible, so Windows still counts that VRAM toward the
  process working set. This is a measured PeakWS tax, not a host leak; HIP
  does not pay it the same way.
- No public reproducible real-backend benchmark or long-audio stability evidence
  is published. The performance harness, regression gates, and competitive
  comparisons are internal (see [Performance](../perf/PERFORMANCE.md)); no claim of
  having finally beaten open-source baselines is made — only that the harness and
  gates are in place.
- No public quality/WER guarantee is claimed for longform timestamps/exports;
  these are validated on internal smoke lanes only.
- Cohere longform carries a model-specific safety policy on top of the shared
  planner contract (chunk cap, no overlap, prompt carry disabled, Metal multichunk
  prefers CPU decoder). It matches current correctness/perf evidence and is not yet
  generalized into a model-agnostic runtime tuning layer.
- System-audio capture now has native smoke backends on macOS, Windows, and
  Linux. Windows additionally supports per-process loopback capture
  (`run_process_loopback_capture`, via `AUDIOCLIENT_ACTIVATION_TYPE_PROCESS_LOOPBACK`)
  alongside its existing all-system WASAPI loopback path; this requires
  Windows 10 2004 (build 19041) or later and is capability-gated by
  `process_loopback_support()`, which performs a real runtime activation
  probe (not an OS-version heuristic, so it cannot be fooled by application
  compatibility shims) and fails closed to "unsupported" on older systems.
  `list_candidate_processes()` enumerates pid + executable name via a
  Toolhelp32 snapshot for callers building a process picker. macOS and Linux
  do not implement per-process capture yet -- both report it as `unsupported`
  through the same capability probe rather than emulating it or silently
  falling back to all-system capture; macOS keeps its Core Audio process-tap
  all-system path and Linux keeps its `pactl`/`parec` monitor-source capture.
  Windows real playback smoke (both all-system and per-process) has been
  executed on a real Windows 11 session; Linux real playback smoke still
  needs to be executed on a Linux session. Per-process capture has no desktop
  UI wiring yet -- it is a library-level API only.
- `serve` is single-model: it runs the one pack resolved at launch
  (`--model-pack` / an installed `--model`). There is no per-request lazy model
  loading or an `openasr ps`-style multi-model runner yet -- restart `serve` to
  switch models.
- `openasr pull` always fetches and re-installs; it has no incremental update
  (no revision/digest diff, `up to date` check, or `--force`). Re-pulling a model
  re-downloads it.
- Source-language control is per-model and capability-gated (see
  `openasr show <pack>` / `/v1/capabilities`). Multilingual Whisper auto-detects an
  unset language and accepts an explicit `--language`; Cohere and the English-only
  families resolve to their fixed/default language. Qwen3-ASR auto-detects
  internally but does **not** expose the detected language, so its reported
  `language` is null and an explicit `--language` is rejected rather than silently
  ignored -- use a multilingual Whisper pack when you need to force or read back the
  language. (Wiring Qwen's text-prompt language conditioning is tracked, but needs a
  real-pack parity check against the reference inference before it can be claimed.)
  Dolphin is specify-only: it does not auto-detect, so an explicit `--language`
  selects one of its 14 recognition codes (`zh` plus 13 Chinese regional-dialect
  codes such as `zh-sichuan`, `zh-shanghai`, `zh-hebei`) via a decode-prompt
  token, defaulting to `zh` when unset; an unsupported code is rejected rather
  than silently falling back.
  SenseVoice accepts an explicit `zh`/`yue`/`en`/`ja`/`ko` selection via its
  4-token decode prompt and auto-detects when unset (the model emits a readable
  language tag); an unsupported code is rejected fail-closed, and a detected
  code outside the advertised set reports `language: null` rather than a guess.
  SenseVoice also classifies emotion and audio events internally, but those
  tags are intentionally not exposed on the API surface yet.
- Cooperative cancel of an in-flight offline transcription is layered:
  request-owned long-form planning/VAD checkpoints plus slice boundaries (L0),
  shared seq2seq greedy token / prefill chunk checks (L1), and a compute-scoped
  ggml abort contract (L2). The built-in neural and energy VAD providers poll
  the same typed request control between bounded recording chunks; custom
  providers that do not override the cancellable method are still checked
  before and after their indivisible call. CPU, Metal, source-enabled CUDA/HIP,
  and Vulkan expose native cancellation hooks; other backends use the shared
  fallback, which submits at most 32-node views and synchronizes between views.
  The capability also reports whether a newly raised request is observed at a
  submission checkpoint or only at graph completion (notably a warmed CUDA/HIP
  graph replay). A scheduler reports the weakest mechanism and coarsest
  observation boundary among its backends and applies the same contract to every
  split, with checks around scheduler input transfers as well, so a missing
  backend-specific proc is never a silent no-op. One already-entered kernel,
  graph replay, event wait, or copy remains non-preemptible; the bound is an
  explicitly reported graph/scheduler checkpoint, not a wall-clock deadline. A
  failed persistent compute poisons its model/session graph and forces graph/KV
  rebuild before reuse; cached backend handles and uploaded immutable weights
  are retained. See
  [Graph cancellation contract](design/graph-cancellation.md).
  Pause still only blocks at slice boundaries and never arms graph cancellation.
- `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions?stream=true` shares owner checks, cancel
  control, and `finish_file` cleanup with JSON file jobs, but a busy server
  rejects the stream with HTTP 429 instead of enqueueing it on the cancelable
  file FIFO. JSON `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` still queues. Desktop remote
  file transcription uses the JSON endpoint. A later change can emit a queued
  SSE event and then stream the result.
