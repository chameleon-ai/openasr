# Known Limitations

This page lists current user-visible limits. For implementation truth and
sequencing, see [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) (Implemented-baseline section).

## Current limitations

- OpenASR publishes binary archives and SHA-256 checksums for macOS, Linux, and
  Windows on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/QuintinShaw/openasr/releases).
  There are no package-manager channels yet; building from source remains
  supported. Public model-pack distribution is limited to catalog entries
  explicitly marked `public:true`.
- The only executable backends are the default `native` and the opt-in `mock`
  stub. Native transcription runs offline from `.oasr` runtime packs -- a pinned
  `--model-pack`, an installed pack, or one the CLI installs on first use through
  a visible consent prompt -- and stays fail-closed by stage.
- The consent-gated CLI pull, the no-silent-download boundary, and pull/install
  mechanics are centralized in [Model Catalog, Registry, and Distribution](MODEL_CATALOG_ARCHITECTURE.md);
  the HTTP server never pulls.
- Realtime cadence is descriptor-driven: any pack whose family has a registered
  streaming executor gets live partials, and every built-in ASR family
  (Qwen3-ASR, Whisper, Cohere Transcribe, Moonshine, Parakeet-CTC, wav2vec2-CTC,
  SenseVoice, Dolphin, and X-ASR) registers one -- a startup completeness gate
  rejects any family that does not. X-ASR is frame-sync-append (append-only
  partials); ChatML utterance LLMs (FunASR-Nano, FireRed-LLM, MiMo-ASR, MOSS)
  are utterance-complete snapshots (incomplete windows may be empty; partials
  may use a short endpoint-silence hint); every other family is a revisable
  snapshot (incomplete windows should produce text, FINAL is byte-identical to
  offline). Official published packs with public product
  guarantees are still pending.
- Universal Voice ID is currently a local **file-transcription** feature. MOSS
  supplies its own speaker turns; all other ASR families use FireRed Stream-VAD,
  a speaker segmenter, ReDimNet2-B6, automatic clustering, and overlap-aware
  reconstruction. Both paths reuse the shared identity/evidence stage and both
  require ReDimNet2-B6. Missing or broken required packs fail closed. This
  universal contract is qualified for local file transcription; realtime and
  remote-compute diarization remain separate surfaces with their own output and
  privacy gates.
  Labels stay session-relative (`SPEAKER_00/01`, ...) unless an enrolled person
  clears Voice ID's evidence gates. See [FAQ.md](FAQ.md#is-diarization-available)
  and [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
- segmentation-3.0 is the default, MIT-licensed external segmenter. DiariZen
  Large-s80-md-v2 is a published optional CC BY-NC 4.0 provider and remains
  fp16-only. Download and activation require explicit non-commercial license
  acknowledgement; merely enabling Voice ID does not install it. Its
  locked six-file F32/Python reference measured 8.1274% DER, and reconstructing
  the qualified mixed-precision pack in the same adapter measured 8.1232%, with
  no material precision loss. The native OpenASR path measured 7.9491% DER
  (3.8806% miss, 1.1348% false alarm, 2.9336% speaker error) under the same
  duration-weighted protocol (0.25 s collar, overlap scored); all six recordings
  beat MOSS, whose aggregate was 18.6787%. That native aggregate transparently
  combines A1-M2 from one process with an identical-runtime M3 supplement after
  the external test harness output pipe failed before M3 started; it is not a
  claim of one uninterrupted six-file process. The historical Base-s80 F32
  reference was 9.0481%, and the segmentation-3.0 research adapter was 12.4466%.
  These fixed Mandarin meeting-slice results qualify the published
  implementation, not a cross-domain guarantee or cross-recording Voice ID
  enrollment/unknown-rejection guarantee; the AISHELL excerpts still
  underestimate speaker count.
- Phrase bias / hotword boosting is implemented for the native runtime decode
  path. Requests still fail closed when the selected model tokenizer cannot
  encode a requested phrase, and the mock backend still rejects non-empty
  phrase-bias requests. Most families apply phrase bias as a per-token logit
  boost during decoding; Dolphin instead runs its upstream-trained native
  deep-biasing context module (`context_module.*`: a BiLSTM context encoder +
  cross-attention fusion into the encoder output ahead of attention rescoring,
  arXiv:2305.12493) and therefore has no per-phrase `boost` weight to apply --
  the phrase *list* is the only signal it honors, and CTC prefix-beam n-best
  generation still runs over the un-biased encoder output (only the
  attention-rescoring decoder input is biased), matching the upstream
  reference decode.
- Word-level timestamp requests are accepted and exported in JSON/VTT. Whisper
  uses native decoder cross-attention frame probabilities and the CTC families
  (parakeet-ctc, wav2vec2-ctc) use decoder frame spans; Qwen, Cohere, and
  Moonshine fall back to decoder token-position estimates because those runtimes
  do not expose acoustic attention, so their word timings are approximate.
  Dolphin does not emit word-level timestamps at all -- its CTC/attention joint
  decode only returns a single segment-level span, so `--word-timestamps`
  requests against a Dolphin pack yield an empty word list rather than an error.
  SenseVoice likewise returns an empty word list: its CTC frames sit on a 60 ms
  low-frame-rate grid behind 4 prompt frames, so per-word times would be
  fabricated precision rather than acoustic timestamps. FireRedASR-AED,
  FireRed2-LLM, FunASR-Nano, MiMo-ASR, Granite Speech, and MOSS likewise return
  empty word lists: those executors expose no usable word-alignment head. The
  signed catalog records this as `word_timestamp_source = "forced_aligner"`;
  families that populate word anchors declare `native`.
- Word-timestamp refinement (`--word-timestamps=aligned` / API
  `timestamp_granularities=word_aligned`) is an opt-in tier on top of the
  approximate timestamps above: it re-runs the finished transcript and the full
  source audio through the Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B capability pack and
  replaces each segment's word spans with the aligner's own output. Passing
  `=aligned` is explicit consent to install the pack. File Voice ID also
  requires this pack automatically for an external ASR whose catalog
  `word_timestamp_source` is `forced_aligner`: Desktop/CLI preflight the
  dependency, while the server remains operator-gated and never downloads.
  At runtime the aligner only executes when the decoded transcript actually
  contains a coarse segment crossing multiple speaker turns. It runs before
  speaker attribution, so its anchors are used to split text exactly; the
  internally requested word list is stripped again unless the caller asked
  for word timestamps. It is native-backend-only and does not
  yet support Japanese or Korean transcripts -- the reference routes those
  through external morphological segmenters (`nagisa`/`soynlp`) that have not
  been ported, so an `aligned` request against ja/ko text fails closed with a
  typed error rather than mis-tokenizing. Other families keep their approximate
  timestamps unchanged. Explicit `aligned` only refines words; the automatic
  Voice ID path additionally consumes those words to assign each text run to
  the canonical speaker timeline.
- Hardware execution target selection is generic: Desktop/server requests support
  `auto`, `cpu`, and `accelerated` when the native runtime reports an accelerated
  device. There is no public per-provider/per-device pinning surface such as
  `gpu0`. Internally the runtime can resolve a concrete execution route
  (`provider` + ggml stable device name + optional PCI `device_id` from CUDA/HIP,
  and from Vulkan when available). What is route-isolated today:
  - thread-local ggml **backend-handle** cache (Exact pin never shares a handle;
    preferred/Auto may Optimus-fall through discrete -> iGPU but always caches
    under the device that actually initialized)
  - streaming **worker** keys
  - device-owning family runtime actor pools: `(PackContentKey, ExecutionLaneKey)`
    (plus adapter fingerprint where applicable); the content key comes from the
    already-open source, so same-path replacement misses
  - serve-batch engine keys (build identity + `ExecutionLaneKey` + family
    capacity geometry)
  What is intentionally **not** partitioned by route:
  - host-neutral prepared data is content-keyed only; its type contract forbids
    backend handles, device buffers, schedulers, graphs, or uploaded arenas
  - **admission capacity stays per model identity** (CPU and accelerated share one
    slot for the same model; route does not multiply capacity)
  Exact device pins are fail-closed: missing devices, init failures, Metal
  (still `MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice` only), and CPU StableId Exact return typed
  not-found / not-addressable / init-failed errors instead of silently swapping
  cards or falling back to CPU. Unavailable coarse `accelerated` targets still
  fail closed. Physical PCI keys are normalized (trim + lower-case) only; full
  BDF grammar validation is a follow-up.
- On Windows ReBAR discrete GPUs, Vulkan Peak Working Set can exceed the HIP
  and CPU figures even when DeviceLocal buffers are not mapped. ReBAR types
  are DeviceLocal|HostVisible, so Windows still counts that VRAM toward the
  process working set. This is a measured PeakWS tax, not a host leak; HIP
  does not pay it the same way.
- No public reproducible real-backend benchmark or long-audio stability evidence
  is published. The performance harness, regression gates, and competitive
  comparisons are internal (see [Performance](../perf/PERFORMANCE.md)); no claim of
  having finally beaten open-source baselines is made — only that the harness and
  gates are in place.
- No public quality/WER guarantee is claimed for longform timestamps/exports;
  these are validated on internal smoke lanes only.
- Cohere longform carries a model-specific safety policy on top of the shared
  planner contract (chunk cap, no overlap, prompt carry disabled, Metal multichunk
  prefers CPU decoder). It matches current correctness/perf evidence and is not yet
  generalized into a model-agnostic runtime tuning layer.
- System-audio capture now has native smoke backends on macOS, Windows, and
  Linux. Windows additionally supports per-process loopback capture
  (`run_process_loopback_capture`, via `AUDIOCLIENT_ACTIVATION_TYPE_PROCESS_LOOPBACK`)
  alongside its existing all-system WASAPI loopback path; this requires
  Windows 10 2004 (build 19041) or later and is capability-gated by
  `process_loopback_support()`, which performs a real runtime activation
  probe (not an OS-version heuristic, so it cannot be fooled by application
  compatibility shims) and fails closed to "unsupported" on older systems.
  `list_candidate_processes()` enumerates pid + executable name via a
  Toolhelp32 snapshot for callers building a process picker. macOS and Linux
  do not implement per-process capture yet -- both report it as `unsupported`
  through the same capability probe rather than emulating it or silently
  falling back to all-system capture; macOS keeps its Core Audio process-tap
  all-system path and Linux keeps its `pactl`/`parec` monitor-source capture.
  Windows real playback smoke (both all-system and per-process) has been
  executed on a real Windows 11 session; Linux real playback smoke still
  needs to be executed on a Linux session. Per-process capture has no desktop
  UI wiring yet -- it is a library-level API only.
- `serve` is single-model: it runs the one pack resolved at launch
  (`--model-pack` / an installed `--model`). There is no per-request lazy model
  loading or an `openasr ps`-style multi-model runner yet -- restart `serve` to
  switch models.
- `openasr pull` always fetches and re-installs; it has no incremental update
  (no revision/digest diff, `up to date` check, or `--force`). Re-pulling a model
  re-downloads it.
- Source-language control is per-model and capability-gated (see
  `openasr show <pack>` / `/v1/capabilities`). Multilingual Whisper auto-detects an
  unset language and accepts an explicit `--language`; Cohere and the English-only
  families resolve to their fixed/default language. Qwen3-ASR auto-detects
  internally but does **not** expose the detected language, so its reported
  `language` is null and an explicit `--language` is rejected rather than silently
  ignored -- use a multilingual Whisper pack when you need to force or read back the
  language. (Wiring Qwen's text-prompt language conditioning is tracked, but needs a
  real-pack parity check against the reference inference before it can be claimed.)
  Dolphin is specify-only: it does not auto-detect, so an explicit `--language`
  selects one of its 14 recognition codes (`zh` plus 13 Chinese regional-dialect
  codes such as `zh-sichuan`, `zh-shanghai`, `zh-hebei`) via a decode-prompt
  token, defaulting to `zh` when unset; an unsupported code is rejected rather
  than silently falling back.
  SenseVoice accepts an explicit `zh`/`yue`/`en`/`ja`/`ko` selection via its
  4-token decode prompt and auto-detects when unset (the model emits a readable
  language tag); an unsupported code is rejected fail-closed, and a detected
  code outside the advertised set reports `language: null` rather than a guess.
  SenseVoice also classifies emotion and audio events internally, but those
  tags are intentionally not exposed on the API surface yet.
- Cooperative cancel of an in-flight offline transcription is layered:
  request-owned long-form planning/VAD checkpoints plus slice boundaries (L0),
  shared seq2seq greedy token / prefill chunk checks (L1), and a compute-scoped
  ggml abort contract (L2). The built-in neural and energy VAD providers poll
  the same typed request control between bounded recording chunks; custom
  providers that do not override the cancellable method are still checked
  before and after their indivisible call. CPU, Metal, source-enabled CUDA/HIP,
  and Vulkan expose native cancellation hooks; other backends use the shared
  fallback, which submits at most 32-node views and synchronizes between views.
  The capability also reports whether a newly raised request is observed at a
  submission checkpoint or only at graph completion (notably a warmed CUDA/HIP
  graph replay). A scheduler reports the weakest mechanism and coarsest
  observation boundary among its backends and applies the same contract to every
  split, with checks around scheduler input transfers as well, so a missing
  backend-specific proc is never a silent no-op. One already-entered kernel,
  graph replay, event wait, or copy remains non-preemptible; the bound is an
  explicitly reported graph/scheduler checkpoint, not a wall-clock deadline. A
  failed persistent compute poisons its model/session graph and forces graph/KV
  rebuild before reuse; cached backend handles and uploaded immutable weights
  are retained. See
  [Graph cancellation contract](design/graph-cancellation.md).
  Pause still only blocks at slice boundaries and never arms graph cancellation.
