# Catalog Forward Compatibility and Client Resilience

This is the normative contract for how a running OpenASR build must handle a
model catalog it did not ship with -- new taxonomy values, new language codes,
a corrupted/incompatible cached copy, or a locally stale anti-rollback floor.
It complements [Model Catalog, Registry, and Distribution](MODEL_CATALOG_ARCHITECTURE.md)
(ownership chain, signing, `openasr pull`) with the specific "what happens when
this build sees data from a *different* catalog epoch" question, motivated by
a real incident (see "Incident background" below).

## The contract

### Must stay fail-closed (security/integrity boundary -- unchanged by this doc)

- **Signature verification failure.** Every catalog source (network, on-disk
  cache, embedded snapshot, explicit local override) requires a valid
  `catalog.signature.json` sidecar under the correct trust root for its
  identity. No source ever skips verification.
- **Epoch rollback on a REMOTE-sourced trust tier.** A catalog fetched over
  the network, or the on-disk cache mirroring what a network fetch previously
  verified, must never be accepted at an epoch below this machine's recorded
  floor (`$OPENASR_HOME/catalog.epoch`). This is the actual attack surface: a
  compromised/malicious catalog endpoint (or MITM) replaying a stale catalog.
  See "Epoch floor at boot" below for the one *narrower* exception this PR
  adds, which is NOT a relaxation of this rule.
- **Structurally broken JSON.** Malformed JSON fails the parse; there is no
  partial/best-effort JSON repair.
- **`schema_version` major above what this build supports.** A structural
  version bump this build cannot interpret at all fails closed.
- **Missing required fields.** A field with no `#[serde(default)]` that is
  absent from the wire document fails the parse for the whole document (not
  scoped to one model) -- this is a "the document doesn't match this build's
  understanding of the format" signal, not a forward-compat case.

None of the above changed in this PR. `model-registry/`'s catalog *data*,
the signing keys, and the epoch/signature verification math are untouched.

### Must tolerate degradation (data evolution -- what this PR fixes)

- **Unknown language/dialect code.** `languages` (and `source_langs` /
  `target_langs`) is a plain `Vec<String>`; any code -- including one a future
  catalog epoch invents -- is preserved verbatim. It never gates model
  visibility and never fails the catalog. Display falls back to the raw code
  when no curated label exists (`crate::models::language::language_display_label`
  returns `None`); this is a display concern, not a catalog-loading one. The
  Rust-side `REGISTERED_DIALECT_CODES` / `validate_language_code` guard in
  `crates/openasr-core/src/models/language.rs` (mirrored in
  `tooling/publish-model/scripts/_catalog.py`) is an **authoring-time typo
  guard only** -- it runs when a maintainer adds a new dialect code to the
  catalog, so `zh-sichaun` fails loudly *before* a signed catalog ships. It
  must never be wired into the runtime catalog-loading path; doing so would
  reintroduce exactly the failure class this document fixes.
- **Unknown model `kind`, `license_class`, or capability `role`.** Each of
  these wire enums (`CatalogModelKind`, `LicenseClass`, `CatalogCapabilityRole`,
  and, for symmetry, `CatalogBackendVendor` / `CatalogBackendFileRole` /
  `CatalogLanguageMode`) carries a `#[serde(other)]` catch-all `Unknown`
  variant, so an unrecognized wire string never fails `serde_json::from_str`.
  `registry::filter_forward_compatible_catalog` then drops (hides) exactly the
  affected model or backend pack -- not the whole catalog -- with a one-line
  `eprintln!` diagnostic (`registry::parse_model_catalog` calls the filter
  right after deserializing, before the existing structural `validate_model_catalog`
  checks run). `license_class` and capability `role` can gate what a client is
  allowed to show/download/stage, so "hide" is the only safe degrade for those
  two; `kind` similarly determines dispatch (market listing vs. capability
  pack vs. translation model), so an unrecognized value must not silently
  masquerade as `asr-model`.
- **Unsupported backend host ABI schemas.** Packs whose host ABI schema differs
  from the supported version remain hidden. Each parse emits one summary with
  the total hidden pack count, counts by schema version, and the supported
  version. Historical releases therefore do not produce a separate log line
  for every pack. Other compatibility diagnostics and all validation failures
  remain unchanged; this is per-load reporting, not process-global suppression.
- **Unknown JSON object keys.** Neither `ModelCatalog` nor `CatalogModel`
  declare `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, so a future field this build
  doesn't know about is already ignored by serde's default behavior. (The
  security-critical signature envelope in `catalog_security.rs` --
  `CatalogSignatureManifest` / `CatalogSignature` -- deliberately keeps
  `deny_unknown_fields`: that is trust-boundary data, not catalog business
  data, and stays strict.)
- **Unknown speaker/timestamp source values.** `CatalogSpeakerSource` and
  `CatalogWordTimestampSource` also carry `Unknown`, but these descriptive
  dependency-planning fields degrade conservatively instead of hiding the ASR
  model: clients plan the external segmenter and forced aligner unless the
  signed value is an explicitly recognized `native`.

### Epoch floor at boot (new in this PR, narrowly scoped)

The anti-rollback floor's job is to stop a **remote** source from replaying a
stale catalog. It was never meant to gate whether a **boot-local candidate**
-- the binary's own embedded snapshot, or an explicit local/bundled catalog
file (`OPENASR_CATALOG_FILE`/`OPENASR_CATALOG_IDENTITY`, the desktop's actual
`openasr serve` startup path) -- is allowed to boot the daemon at all. A
boot-local candidate can legitimately sit below a floor this same machine
previously recorded with no attack involved: an older release reinstalled
over a newer one (its embedded epoch predates what the newer build fetched),
or a dev/test tool populating `$OPENASR_HOME/catalog.epoch` from an unrelated,
newer catalog snapshot (the actual root cause below).

So, **only** for `load_embedded_signed_catalog` and
`load_local_catalog_file_with_identity` (`registry.rs`), a below-floor epoch
that is otherwise fully verified (signature, structure) degrades instead of
failing closed:

- `catalog_security::enforce_boot_catalog_epoch_for_verified` returns
  `BootEpochOutcome::BelowFloor { floor }` rather than
  `Err(EpochRollback)`.
- The caller logs a warning, records `CatalogDegradedStatus { tier, reason }`
  (see "Status surface" below), and serves the catalog anyway.
- The recorded floor is **never** pulled backward: a degraded load must not
  call `record_catalog_epoch_for_verified` for its own (lower) epoch. A
  later, genuinely fresher network catalog is still held to the real, unmoved
  floor.

The network/cache trust tier (`load_model_catalog`'s primary source,
`load_signed_catalog_from_cache`) keeps the strict, unchanged
`enforce_catalog_epoch_for_verified` -- a rollback there still fails that
*source*, though the overall `load_model_catalog` call still degrades to a
good cache/embedded catalog via the fallback chain below (that part is not
new; a below-floor primary source has always fallen through to
`load_cached_signed_catalog`).

Test scenarios (`crates/openasr-core/src/registry/tests/catalog.rs` and
`catalog_security.rs`'s own test module):

- **Scenario A** -- `embedded_catalog_degrades_instead_of_bricking_on_epoch_rollback`:
  the embedded snapshot, as the last-resort tier, degrades rather than
  erroring when the recorded floor is ahead of it.
- **Scenario B** -- `bundled_local_catalog_degrades_instead_of_bricking_on_epoch_rollback`:
  the same for `load_local_catalog_file_with_identity` (the desktop bundled-catalog
  path), using the real committed `model-registry/catalog.json` + signature
  with an artificially inflated recorded floor (no forged signature needed).
- **Scenario C** -- `boot_epoch_degrades_below_floor_while_strict_enforcement_stays_fail_closed`
  (in `catalog_security.rs`): for the identical (production-key, below-floor)
  verified signature, `enforce_catalog_epoch_for_verified` (remote/cache tier)
  still fails closed while `enforce_boot_catalog_epoch_for_verified`
  (boot-local tier) degrades -- pinning the exact behavioral split this
  section describes.

## Client resilience (load -> cache -> serve)

1. **Verify-then-persist.** A catalog is only ever written to
   `$OPENASR_HOME/catalog.json` (+ signature/epoch sidecars) *after* it fully
   verifies, parses, and passes forward-compat filtering + structural
   validation (`registry::persist_catalog_cache`, called only from the
   `Ok(catalog)` branch of every loader). A bad candidate never overwrites a
   good cache -- see `catalog_loader_does_not_cache_invalid_source` and
   `catalog_loader_falls_back_to_last_good_cache_when_local_source_is_tampered_without_resigning`.
   A disk-write failure while persisting a verified catalog does not fail the
   in-memory result either (`persist_catalog_cache` logs and continues) --
   the catalog this call already verified is safe to serve for this request
   regardless of whether the cache write succeeds.
2. **Fallback chain.** `load_model_catalog`'s primary source
   (`Ok(verified) => ...`) now falls through to
   `load_cached_signed_catalog` (on-disk cache, then the embedded snapshot) on
   ANY post-signature failure -- parse error, structural validation error, or
   the staged-entries anomaly below -- not just a transport/signature
   failure. Before this PR, `let catalog = parse_model_catalog(...)?;`
   propagated the error directly out of `load_model_catalog`, skipping the
   fallback chain entirely: a signature-valid but structurally-wrong primary
   payload bricked the load with a perfectly good on-disk cache sitting right
   there unused. `load_local_catalog_file_with_identity` (desktop bundled
   catalog) got the same fix, reusing the identical fallback chain.
3. **No same-cause crash loop.** Because (a) a bad primary source now always
   falls back instead of erroring, and (b) a below-floor boot-local candidate
   degrades instead of erroring, there is no longer a `load_*` path that
   fails identically on every restart with a perfectly good fallback
   available. `catalog_security::record_catalog_degraded` /
   `clear_catalog_degraded` persist which state the daemon is in
   (`$OPENASR_HOME/catalog.degraded.json`) so this is visible, not silent.

### Status surface

`openasr_core::read_catalog_degraded_status(home) -> Option<CatalogDegradedStatus>`
(`{ tier: "cache" | "embedded" | "local", reason: String }`) is best-effort
(never errors) and is surfaced two ways:

- **`openasr doctor`**: `Model registry: degraded, serving the <tier> catalog
  (<n> models) -- <reason>` instead of `Model registry: ok (<n> models)`.
- **Server `GET /health`**: additive `catalog_degraded: string | null` field
  (`null` = primary source, or no catalog load recorded yet). See
  `crates/openasr-server/generated/http-wire/HealthResponse.ts`.

## The "staged entries under the production identity" anomaly

The production `catalog.openasr.org` endpoint -- and therefore the on-disk
cache mirroring what it served, and the binary's embedded snapshot -- only
ever serves the **public projection** (`catalog.public.json`: `public: true`
entries only). The full, internal `model-registry/catalog.json` intentionally
carries staged (`public: false`) pre-release entries so a contributor can
preview an unreleased model locally (see "Root cause" below); it is
independently signed under the same production key and the same
`catalog_url` identity as the public projection (both are legitimate,
production-signed artifacts -- signing them separately is intentional, not a
bug).

If a payload verified under the **production** signing key (a real network
fetch, or the on-disk cache of one -- see
`catalog_security::participates_in_epoch_floor`) carries ANY `public: false`
entry, that is a data anomaly for that trust tier, not a security violation
(the signature is still valid): `registry::parse_and_check_production_catalog`
refuses it (`CatalogError::UnexpectedStagedEntries`) and the caller's fallback
chain takes over exactly as it would for any other post-signature failure.

This check is deliberately **not** applied to
`load_local_catalog_file_with_identity` / `preview_local_catalog_file_with_identity`:
the desktop's `OPENASR_CATALOG_FILE` bundled-catalog path and the CLI's
repo-checkout dev-preview path are both legitimate reasons to load the full
catalog under the production identity (dev preview needs the staged entries
on purpose).

Test: `cache_polluted_with_full_non_public_catalog_degrades_to_embedded_instead_of_bricking`
reproduces this exactly (copies the real, production-signed full catalog into
the cache position, then loads through `load_cached_signed_catalog` offline)
and asserts the daemon still starts, serving the embedded (public-only)
catalog, with `catalog_degraded.tier == "embedded"`.

## Incident background and root cause

**2026-07-16, corrected narrative.** The initial report described a "line
catalog with new dialect codes bricked v0.1.15". Real-binary testing showed
this was wrong: v0.1.15 loads the online (dialect-carrying) catalog fine.
Forensics on a contributor machine instead found:

- **Cache pollution.** `$OPENASR_HOME/catalog.json` (+ signature + epoch) held
  the repo's **full, non-public** catalog projection instead of the public
  one -- see "The staged entries anomaly" above for why that is meaningful.
- **The actual write point:** `catalog_cli.rs`'s repo-checkout dev-preview
  auto-discovery. `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents `cargo run -p openasr-cli --
  doctor` (and `list`, `transcribe`, ...) as the normal contributor dev loop,
  run with no `OPENASR_HOME` override -- which resolves to the real
  `$HOME/.openasr`. Before this PR, that auto-discovery path loaded
  `model-registry/catalog.json` (the full, staged-entries-including file)
  under the production identity via
  `load_local_catalog_file_with_identity`, which **also cached it** into
  `$OPENASR_HOME/catalog.json` -- the exact same path the real, installed
  release binary reads as its offline fallback. A single ordinary `cargo run
  -p openasr-cli -- doctor` from a checkout was enough to contaminate the
  real daemon's cache.
- **Why it then bricked (rather than just leaking staged models):** the
  contaminated cache's `catalog.epoch` (from a newer catalog epoch than the
  installed v0.1.15 build's own embedded snapshot) became the recorded
  anti-rollback floor. When the installed build later needed to fall back to
  its embedded snapshot (e.g. offline), that snapshot's own (older, real)
  epoch was now BELOW the locally-inflated floor, so
  `enforce_catalog_epoch_for_verified` rejected it with `EpochRollback` --
  and, before this PR, there was no further fallback: the daemon had nothing
  left to serve.

**Fixes landed here, mapped to the mechanism:**

1. `catalog_cli.rs`'s auto-discovery now calls the new
   `preview_local_catalog_file_with_identity` (read-only: same
   verify/parse/degrade behavior, but never writes
   `$OPENASR_HOME/catalog.json`) instead of the caching
   `load_local_catalog_file_with_identity` -- closes the actual write point.
   `load_local_catalog_file_with_identity` remains available (and caching)
   for its one real caller, the desktop's `OPENASR_CATALOG_FILE` bundled
   catalog.
2. "Epoch floor at boot": even if a floor mismatch like this recurs (a
   dev-tool artifact, or a legitimate app downgrade/reinstall), the affected
   boot-local candidate now degrades instead of bricking.
3. The fallback chain fix (`load_model_catalog`'s primary tier now falls
   through to cache/embedded on any post-signature failure, not just a
   transport/signature failure) is defense in depth for the same class of
   failure regardless of its trigger.
4. The "staged entries under production identity" guard specifically detects
   *this* contamination shape (full catalog where only the public projection
   belongs) even if it reappears through some other path in the future.

No signing key, catalog data, or epoch/signature verification math changed;
`model-registry/` is untouched by this fix.
