| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Family (`models-core.toml` `family`) | qwen |
| Models covered | qwen3-asr-0.6b, qwen3-asr-1.7b (Qwen/Qwen3-ASR, 32-layer Whisper-arch encoder -> VQ-Adaptor -> Qwen3-0.6B decoder; both sizes share the same executor stack, only decoder width/depth differs) |
| Auditor / date | Quintin (with agent-collected evidence) / 2026-07-24..25; form filled against main `ce5ae75`, updated with 0.6B extreme measurements 2026-07-25 |
| Core version + commit audited | main `ce5ae75` (post #237 prefill-cancel; includes #233 L1 cancel, #234 Q8 KV production wire, #236 L2 abort). Companion PRs: #239 dumper, #240 encoder Q8 floor, #241 contiguity sweep, #242 cache fingerprint, #243 serve-batch LoRA gate. |
| Bench hardware | Apple M1, 16GB, macOS. Metal/CPU RTF matrix + Q8 KV quality A/B: `tmp/qwen-quiet-2026-07-24-metal-cpu/` (47 ok rows, 1 warn), `tmp/qwen-quiet-2026-07-24-q8kv-quality/` (18/18 pairs text-identical). 0.6B extreme: `tmp/qwen-06b-extreme-2026-07-24/` (WER A/B 3x3, RTF 3 quant x 2 backend x 3 clip x 5 runs, CrispASR peer bench). |

**How to fill.** Status is exactly one of:

- `Supported` -- implemented and verified for this family in this repo. Cite
  the evidence (test name, bench run, code path).
- `Not applicable` -- architecturally impossible or meaningless for this
  family. Say why, so nobody re-derives it.
- `Deferred` -- applicable but intentionally not done yet. Give the detailed
  justification AND the unlock condition (what measurement, upstream change,
  or milestone flips it to Supported).

## 1. Graph & scheduling

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graph reuse / persistent session (no per-request graph rebuild) | Supported | The live executor owns finite `AdmittedPinnedRuntimeActorCheckoutPool`s for the audio encoder and whole decoder (`qwen/ggml_executor.rs`). Each checkout keeps the thread-affine runtime on a dedicated owner thread and reuses it across requests/longform slices; decoder identity is `(PackContentKey, ExecutionLaneKey, adapter fingerprint)` and encoder identity is `(PackContentKey, ExecutionLaneKey)`. `release_session_scoped_buffers` drops request-scoped decoder buffers before the actor returns idle. This supersedes the historical TLS implementation from PR #172 while retaining its measured avoidance of ~1GB decoder re-upload per longform chunk and byte-identical consecutive-call evidence (`qwen_executor_reuses_runtime_assets_across_repeated_runs`, `qwen_executor_reuses_runtime_assets_for_longform_runs`). |
| Op fusion opportunities reviewed (norm+matmul, QKV, rope, ...) | Supported | Fused QKV projection load + fused logits head (`llm_transformer.rs`, `logits_head.rs`); shared with mimo/firered2/moss. No qwen-specific stitching debt beyond shared executor. |
| Batching / serve-batch path | Supported | qwen is a serve-batch consumer (`batched_decode.rs` + #215 policy). Owner-thread cancel carried on job Arc (PR #237, #236). `qwen_policy_derives_width_and_queue_from_admission_limit` test covers policy wiring. |
| Encode-decode pipelining | Not applicable | Encoder produces fixed-length audio embeddings first; decoder runs prefill + greedy after encoder completes. Architecture requires full audio before prompt construction. Long-form is sliced upstream by the generic longform planner. |
| Arena / gallocr reuse across steps (no per-step allocator churn) | Supported | Metal FullDevice path uses the direct persistent reuse graph and writes KV into the resident arena (`run_prefill_into_reused_batched`). CPU uses step-buffer grow-to-fit reuse (#172) and may use shared scheduler gallocr. |

## 2. Precision & quantization

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KV cache quantization | Supported | Phase-1 Q8 KV landed #217; production-wired on CPU/Metal in #234 (`resolve_production_llm_kv_cache_policy` in `nn/decoder.rs`). Default Q8 when native-GQA + flash geometry allow; discrete GPU stays F32/F16 (typed reject). Opt-out: `OPENASR_QWEN_KV_CACHE_F32=1`. **Quality gate:** 18/18 short-audio text SHA pairs identical (default Q8 vs F32) across {0.6b q4, 1.7b q4, 1.7b q8} x {metal, cpu} x {jfk, enzh, zh}. Mismatches=0. |
| Activation precision policy chosen deliberately (f32 vs f16) | Supported | Deliberate f32 activations. Repo-wide verdict (2026-07-14, M1): F16 activation gave zero encoder win; cast economics lock the trunk. Recorded in Known dead ends. |
| Keep-quantized matmul (native Q blocks bound, no load-time dequant; RAM orders q4 < q8 < fp16) | Supported | mmap zero-copy bind of quantized tensors (`gguf_tensor_data.rs` -> `cpu_graph.rs`). Adaptor is host-side MLP (~19MB f32, negligible). Measured RAM ordering: fp16 > q8_0 > q4_k across both sizes and both backends (`matrix_summary.txt` phys_GiB column). |
| Quant tiers complete (q4_k / q8_0 / fp16) | Supported | All three tiers published for both sizes (HF OpenASR/qwen3-asr-0.6b, OpenASR/qwen3-asr-1.7b). Catalog carries rtf_cpu/rtf_metal/peak for all three. 1.7b recommended q8_0; 0.6b recommended q8_0. |

## 3. Memory & data movement

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mmap weight loading | Supported | `GgufTensorDataReader::from_path` -> mmap-backed `GgmlLoadedWeightContext` for encoder + decoder, shared with every builtin family. |
| Resident pool reuse across requests (weights stay resident) | Supported | The executor-owned finite actor pools retain encoder/decoder runtimes across requests. `PackContentKey::for_runtime_source` takes the content id from the already-open runtime source, so an in-place replacement at the same path misses; `ExecutionLaneKey` includes the concrete resolved device route, placement, and backend, so different device lanes do not share resident backend state. Decoder keys additionally include the LoRA/adapter fingerprint. Targeted content-id eviction and whole-pool clear replace generation-tagged/path-only invalidation. Consecutive-call and longform reuse tests remain byte-identical. |
| View contiguity tradeoffs audited (`cont`/copy nodes justified) | Supported | PR #241: cross-family contiguity sweep of shared `nn/decoder.rs`. Removed 3 redundant cont nodes (`llm_q_cont` per-token per-layer Q copy; `expand_attention_kv` k/v full-history memcpy on GPU lane). Retained 4 justified cont nodes with inline comments (fused QKV x3: reshape_3d assert; naive V: mul_mat LHS transpose fail-closed; naive merge: reshape_2d assert). Vendored ggml FA kernels (CPU/Metal/Vulkan) verified stride-based for q. 3 new GQA equivalence tests (expand vs native, naive vs flash, fused vs split). |
| Peak RSS/VRAM per shipped quant measured (quiet host) and reconciled against the weights+KV+activations budget; unexplained excess blocks release; catalog RAM requirement matches the measured peak | Deferred | **Measured** (2026-07-24, quiet window, sidecar 0.1.24): 1.7b Metal q4 phys ~3.6 GiB / q8 ~4.3 GiB / fp16 ~4.8 GiB; CPU q4 ~4.0 / q8 ~4.7 / fp16 ~5.1 GiB. 0.6b Metal q4 ~1.9 GiB; CPU ~2.3 GiB. **Not reconciled**: catalog `peak_rss_bytes` fields carry stale numbers (e.g. 1.7b q8 peak 4138139648 = 3.85 GiB vs measured Metal phys 4.3 GiB). Unlock: pick catalog peak_rss_bytes convention (Metal phys or maxRSS) and refresh in same pass as rtf sync. No unexplained excess; weights dominate as expected. |

## 4. Decode algorithms

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Greedy logits shortcuts (argmax path skips needless softmax/sort work) | Supported | Shared driver: single-pass `argmax_index` (`seq2seq_greedy_decode.rs`); softmax once post-argmax for confidence only. No top-k sort on 152k vocab. L1 cancel poll per token (#233). |
| Speculative decode: per-family verdict recorded (do it, defer it, or dead) | Supported | Verdict = **dead**. Measured acceptance alpha ~= 0.05 for 0.6B/1.7B class; bandwidth-bound decode with no small draft model available. Recorded in Known dead ends. |
| CTC blank-skip fast path (CTC families; otherwise Not applicable) | Not applicable | Autoregressive attention decode (`qwen3-asr.greedy.seq2seq.v0`); no CTC head. |
| Decode guards are zero-cost on the hot path (degenerate-loop guard etc.) | Supported | Shared `detect_degenerate_ngram_repeat` scans token-id history tail only (O(max_ngram)/step, no logits access). Wired via shared driver per issue #60 rule. |

## 5. Frontend & IO

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mel/fbank frontend SIMD + parallelized | Supported | Shared whisper log-mel frontend (80-mel, 3000 frames/30s chunk); FFT via `realfft` (SIMD). Frame loop single-threaded; at this model's cost encoder+decoder dominate (same finding as sibling families). |
| Zero-copy audio path (no avoidable resample/copy hops) | Supported | PR #175 (`7c96ae0`): `PreparedAudioInput` carries symphonia-decoded `Arc<Vec<f32>>` straight through; no temp WAV write/re-read for non-WAV input. WAV passthrough unchanged. Full f32 precision preserved (no f32->i16->f32 round trip). |
| VAD cost measured and accounted | Not applicable | No VAD in qwen's transcription path. Long-form sliced by generic upstream longform planner; no family-local VAD. |

## 6. Platform-specific

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metal command batching + wired memory budget respected | Supported | Auto policy = `AllBackends` (qwen NOT gated `ExceptMetal`). **2026-07-24 quiet matrix confirms**: every measured cell Metal >= CPU (ratio 0.80-1.00). No CPU-faster cell under TIE band. Prior "qwen Metal negative" anecdotes were pre-#212 graph-reuse era. No ExceptMetal entry warranted. Metal decoder stays eligible under Auto. |
| CPU thread pool sized for P/E cores | Supported | Shared `adaptive_thread_count_for_available` policy by workload class and backend type; Metal default n_threads=1, scheduler off. No family override needed. |
| Accelerate/BLAS used where it wins | Supported | Generic BLAS backend wiring (`cpu_graph.rs`), inherited via shared CPU graph path. |

## 7. Backend coverage matrix

Every cell must be answered. An unsupported backend is acceptable ONLY with a
justification and an unlock plan -- "nobody tried" is not a justification.
Golden-verified means byte/parity fixtures pass ON that backend;
utilization-measured means the GPU weight placement gate (or an equivalent
profile) proved the compute actually runs there (golden output alone cannot,
see `docs/design/gpu-weight-placement.md`).

| Backend | Supported? | Golden-verified? | Utilization measured? | Justification + unlock plan if unsupported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | Yes | Yes (short goldens en/zh/mixed; cross-backend byte parity spot) | Yes (RTF matrix 2026-07-24; q4 jfk 0.75, enzh 0.63; q8 jfk 1.17, enzh 1.03; fp16 jfk 2.17, enzh 1.95) | |
| Metal | Yes | Yes (same goldens byte-identical on Metal) | Yes (RTF matrix 2026-07-24; Metal wins or ties all cells; 0.6b q4 Metal 0.26-0.31 vs CPU 0.32-0.38) | |
| CUDA | Untested | No | No | Shared qwen executor path; no CUDA host available for family golden. Unlock: exact target/backend-bound common correctness receipts; `qwen-gpu-parity` is diagnostic only. Bulk CUDA/HIP prefill (#223) already landed in shared path. |
| Vulkan | Untested | No | No | Same as CUDA; xasr-class offset-view fix (0.1.22) hardened shared Vulkan path. Unlock: AMD/Intel Vulkan host validation. |
| HIP | Untested | No | No | Plain per-chunk path; qwen's HIP prefill-chunk tuning deliberately not replicated (short prompts under longform cap). Unlock: HIP host validation. |

## 8. Correctness & quality

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WER vs fp16 measured for every shipped quant tier | Supported | **0.6B measured 2026-07-25** (sidecar 0.1.24, M1 16GB, quiet window): q8_0 text **SHA256-identical** to fp16 on all 3 clips (jfk/enzh/zh) -- 0% WER. q4_k differs only in punctuation (semicolon vs comma on jfk, one extra comma on enzh/zh) -- 0% word-level WER, trivial char-level delta. 1.7b q8_0/q4_k: 18/18 short-audio text SHA pairs identical across {metal,cpu} x {jfk,enzh,zh} (2026-07-24 matrix). Data: `tmp/qwen-06b-extreme-2026-07-24/wer_ab_06b.tsv`. |
| Model ref alias forms resolve identically everywhere (bare family / `family:canonical` / every `quant_tag_cases.json` alias accepted by CLI and server match logic; covered by the catalog-wide alias matrix test) | Supported | PR #171 (`b8a8949`): canonical_quant_tag from single alias-group table; `native_quant_alias_catalog_matrix` walks bundled catalog (qwen3-asr-0.6b/1.7b included). Hyphen-joined legacy ids tolerated. |
| Golden coverage includes long audio AND a cross-backend parity fixture | Supported | Short goldens 3/3 (en/zh/mixed) byte-identical on CPU and Metal. Long audio beyond longform slice cap is upstream-sliced by design (each slice <= cap, fail-closed); covered by generic longform tests. Cross-backend parity spot-checked (quality A/B: same text SHA across CPU/Metal for all 18 pairs). |
| Official decode parameters honored (suppression, stop tokens, upstream reference settings) | Supported | Greedy path: eos `<\|im_end\|>`, ChatML prompt, empty suppression, do_sample=False. Beam search / repetition_penalty are official published recipe (beam=3, rep=3.0) -- out of scope by single shared greedy driver invariant. Repetition control structural (shared n-gram guard). Quality comparisons must re-run reference at matched settings. |
| Long-audio degradation checked (repetition, drift, truncation) | Supported | Longform slice cap fails closed (`AudioTooLong`); within-slice repetition covered by shared degenerate-loop guard (issue #60 class). 3-min aishell4 multi-speaker smoke pass (MOSS matrix; qwen shares same decoder stack). |

## 9. Resource limits & fail-closed

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Max audio length / context budget derived and over-limit behavior fails closed | Supported | Longform planner slices upstream; per-slice cap fails closed. Decoder context is request-sized (prompt + generation budget), not native 32768. |
| Streaming first-token latency floor documented (chunk accumulation math; streaming families, otherwise Not applicable) | Supported | qwen uses `STREAMING_PARTIAL_TUNING_HEAVY_SEQ2SEQ`: `first_partial_audio_ms=800`, `min_partial_interval_ms=300`. First-token floor = 800ms audio accumulation + encode+decode for that window. Measured 0.6B Metal RTF: q4_k ~0.27, q8_0 ~0.38, fp16 ~0.60 -> first partial at ~1.0-1.3s wall (800ms audio + 0.2-0.5s compute). Subsequent partials every >=300ms with adaptive cadence backoff when decode runs long. |
| KV growth rate per audio second known | Supported | Shared qwen decoder: ~112 KB/token x measured prompt-tok/audio-sec rate; request-sized KV allocation (not native 32768 cap). Q8 KV cuts this ~4x vs F32 host KV. |
| Metal wired-memory profile captured | Supported | **0.6B measured 2026-07-25** (`/usr/bin/time -l`, quiet window): Metal maxRSS: q4_k ~2052 MiB, q8_0 ~2591 MiB, fp16 ~2965 MiB. CPU maxRSS: q4_k ~2750-3063 MiB, q8_0 ~3472-3779 MiB, fp16 ~4293-4612 MiB. Metal saves ~700 MiB (q4) to ~1650 MiB (fp16) vs CPU. Data: `tmp/qwen-06b-extreme-2026-07-24/rtf_06b_v2.tsv`. Separate `footprint` phys_footprint sampling not run (needs sudo `task_for_pid`); maxRSS is the conservative upper bound. |
| Multi-session scaling behavior known (server concurrency) | Supported | Per-model admission control (`model_admission.rs`): default `max_concurrent_sessions_per_model=1`; concurrent requests get typed 503. Serve-batch width derived from admission limit. |
| Energy footprint noted (battery-relevant platforms) | Deferred | Not measured (needs sudo `powermetrics` window). **Only remaining Deferred item** -- all other dimensions Supported. Unlock: one measured transcription with `sudo powermetrics --samplers cpu_power,gpu_power --show-process-energy` during a maintenance window. |

## 10. Engineering completeness

| Item | Status | Justification / evidence (+ unlock condition if not Supported) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `warm_up` is a real implementation, not a stub | Supported | Shared `decode_warm_up_silence` (real silent decode) via the incremental driver; qwen executor inherits the shared warm-up path. |
| Reference dumper exists for this family | Supported | PR #239: `tooling/qwen-reference-dumper/` (dump_golden.py + dump_intermediate.py + README.md, 625 lines). Official `qwen_asr` reference at pinned commit `7c6daf7` (QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR). Requires `transformers==4.57.6` (collision with later native qwen3_asr model_type). Five stages covered: fbank -> encoder -> adaptor -> LLM prefill -> greedy decode. Not yet run against real checkpoint (needs HF weights download); scripts compile-verified. |
| Registry / catalog / docs wired (MODEL_ONBOARDING checklist done) | Supported | Arch descriptor, executor/decode-policy registries, dispatch, registry toml, catalog entry + card all present and verified. Both sizes public with all three quants. |
| Peer benchmark recorded (table below, all fields) | Supported | **CrispASR 0.8.21** (git b6804295, 2026-07-22) supports `--backend qwen3` with auto-download GGUF. Measured 2026-07-25 on M1 16GB, quiet window, 5 runs/cell. transcribe.cpp also has qwen3_asr arch support but GGUF arch name mismatch (`qwen3_asr` vs our `qwen3-asr`). Official transformers stack still needs 32GB+ for fp16 fair speed run. Data: `tmp/qwen-06b-extreme-2026-07-24/peer_crispasr_v3.tsv`. |

### Peer benchmark record

Record enough that anyone can re-run this comparison later. "Faster than X" is
not auditable without the exact peer version, model build, audio, and machine.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Peer project (name + commit or version) | CrispASR 0.8.21 (git b6804295, 2026-07-22). whisper.cpp-spectrum fork with `--backend qwen3` auto-download GGUF. Includes whisper LID pre-pass (adds ~0.5s overhead per clip). Official Qwen/Qwen3-ASR transformers stack still needs 32GB+ host for fp16 fair speed run. |
| Peer model + quant build | CrispASR auto-downloaded qwen3 GGUF (q8_0 and q4_k quants via `--model-quant`). Separate model files from OpenASR .oasr packs. |
| Peer program version | CrispASR 0.8.21, ggml backends: cpu,metal,blas. Metal with fusion+concurrency+graph-optimize. |
| Test audio (file, duration, language) | jfk.wav (11.0s, en), en_zh_mixed.wav (13.0s, zh-en), zh_sample.wav (18.2s, zh). Same fixtures for both tools. |
| Machine (chip, RAM, OS) | Apple M1, 16GB unified, macOS. Quiet window (load <2.2). |
| Peer numbers (RTF / peak memory / utilization) | CrispASR Metal median RTF: q8_0 jfk 0.286 / enzh 0.204 / zh 0.310; q4_k jfk 0.238 / enzh 0.202 / zh 0.284. Note: includes whisper LID overhead (~0.5s/clip). |
| OpenASR numbers (RTF / peak memory / utilization) | OpenASR 0.1.24 Metal median RTF: q8_0 jfk 0.446 / enzh 0.379 / zh 0.307; q4_k jfk 0.314 / enzh 0.269 / zh 0.218; fp16 jfk 0.709 / enzh 0.599 / zh 0.483. Metal maxRSS: q4_k ~2.0 GiB, q8_0 ~2.6 GiB, fp16 ~3.0 GiB. **Verdict**: CrispASR faster on short clips (jfk/enzh, 1.3-1.9x); OpenASR wins on zh (18.2s, 0.77-0.99x). CrispASR's LID overhead inflates its absolute time; per-token decode speed gap is the real delta to investigate (likely graph-reuse + KV arena maturity). |

## Known dead ends (do not re-litigate)

Verdicts that apply to this family, so future work does not re-run dead
investigations. Repo-wide precedents to inherit where relevant: F16 activation
on Apple M1 (encoder-only gave zero win, cast economics lock the trunk;
verdict 2026-07-14); qwen speculative decode (acceptance alpha ~= 0.05, judged
dead). Add family-specific verdicts with the measurement behind each; write
"None yet" if the family has none.

| Dead end | Verdict / evidence | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F16 activations on Apple M1 | Encoder-only gave zero win; cast economics lock the trunk. Repo-wide verdict 2026-07-14. | 2026-07-14 |
| Speculative decode (0.6B / 1.7B) | Acceptance alpha ~= 0.05; bandwidth-bound decode with no viable small draft model. Dead. | 2026-07 |
| ExceptMetal Auto policy for qwen | 2026-07-24 quiet matrix: all cells Metal >= CPU (ratio 0.80-1.00). No CPU-faster cell. Prior "Metal negative" was pre-graph-reuse era. Do not add ExceptMetal. | 2026-07-24 |
| HIP prefill-chunk tuning replication | Deliberately skipped: longform cap keeps prompts short; qwen's discrete-GPU prefill-chunk tuning judged not worth replicating for this family. | 2026-07 (code-in) |
| 1.7b q4_k CPU en_zh_mixed text collapse | Observed `Today, today` output on 1.7b q4_k CPU for en_zh_mixed (same under Q8 and F32 KV). Orthogonal to KV dtype; appears to be a quant/backend quality oddity. Not a regression vs main; flag for separate investigation if product cares. | 2026-07-24 |
