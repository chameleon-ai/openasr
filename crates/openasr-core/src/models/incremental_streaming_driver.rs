//! Re-decode streaming driver, shared by all six runtime families (qwen / cohere /
//! moonshine / whisper, and the CTC families parakeet / wav2vec2). Each tick it
//! re-decodes the current (undrained) segment with full context. qwen-class seq2seq
//! models expose no real token timestamps, so it maps the decoded characters to
//! proportional absolute times to find the settled prefix; a sentence that has
//! stopped being revised (its proportional end is `COMMIT_STABILITY_MARGIN_MS`
//! behind the live edge) is finalized into its own caption segment and its audio is
//! drained — Whisper-Streaming buffer trimming. So each finalized sentence is a
//! stable line and the trailing partial is the live, revisable tail.
//!
//! Nothing is accumulated across re-decodes: every partial and segment is recomputed
//! from the latest full decode, which is what keeps boundaries from drifting or
//! duplicating. The FINAL re-decodes the whole (drained) buffer with the same prompt
//! context the trailing segment's partials used, so it stays consistent with the last
//! partial instead of jumping at finalization.
