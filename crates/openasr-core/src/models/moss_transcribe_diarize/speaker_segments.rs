//! Normalizes moss-transcribe-diarize's inline `[start][end][SNN]` speaker /
//! time-anchor markup -- ordinary BPE tokens the Qwen3 decoder emits as
//! literal transcript *characters* (see the module doc) -- into the engine's
//! shared representation: [`Segment`]s carrying clean text plus, when the
//! request asked for speakers, the recording-local `SPEAKER_NN` labels the
//! model asserted.
//!
//! # Normalization is unconditional; keeping the labels is not
//!
//! The decode prompt is a fixed instruction the checkpoint was fine-tuned
//! against (see `decode_prompt`), so the model writes its markers whether or
//! not the user asked for speakers -- there is no "plain transcript" decode
//! mode to switch to. That makes stripping the markup this layer's job, not the
//! caller's: the markers are an internal transport for structure, never
//! transcript content, so they are removed from the text on every path. With
//! Voice ID off the speaker labels are dropped as well, and what a caller gets
//! back is byte-for-byte what a model that cannot separate speakers would have
//! produced. Leaving the stripping to a renderer would leak the markers into
//! every copy/export path and make this family behave differently from every
//! other one under the same switch.
//!
//! This mirrors the one existing precedent for turning a family's own inline
//! diarization markup into `Segment`s:
//! `cohere::decoder_graph::cohere_diarized_segments_from_generated_tokens`.
//! The shapes differ because the underlying signal differs -- cohere's
//! `<|spltoken0|>` / `<|t:2.4|>` are dedicated vocabulary entries the tokenizer
//! can recognize by token id before any text decode, so a malformed stream is
//! not really reachable; moss-td's tags are ordinary characters the model
//! free-generates as part of its text, so a malformed tag stream is a real,
//! reachable failure mode this parser must handle without guessing. Both
//! parsers make the same "never invent a speaker" call (see
//! [`parse_moss_td_speaker_segments`]'s fail-closed policy below) and both
//! write the same shared field, [`Segment::speaker_label`] -- the one
//! recording-local speaker representation the engine carries, which an
//! external source (`crate::diarize::pipeline::Diarization` -> attribution)
//! also lands on. That is what lets in-decoder and external sources stay
//! interchangeable downstream, including for the identity stage
//! (`crate::diarize::voice_id`).
//!
//! An external source additionally carries a per-turn `overlap` flag this
//! in-decoder path has no signal for, plus a per-turn confidence neither
//! source populates today (cf.
//! [`crate::api::backend::WordTimestamp::confidence`]). [`Segment`] carries
//! neither, and moss-td asserts neither, so nothing is lost now -- but a
//! future consumer that wants the VAD path's overlap/confidence must grow
//! [`Segment`] additively (a new `Option`/`#[serde(default)]` field) rather
//! than reshape it. Flagged here so that growth stays a conscious additive
//! step, not a breaking change.
//!
//! # Tags are ordinary characters: an inherent ambiguity
//!
//! Because moss-td's `[t]`/`[Sxx]` markers are ordinary transcript characters
//! rather than reserved control tokens, this parser cannot tell a structural
//! tag apart from transcript content that merely *looks* like one. If the
//! decoded text itself contains a bracketed number (say the model wrote
//! `meeting at [3.30] pm`) that span is consumed as a time anchor and the
//! segment splits there; a bracketed `[Sxx]` sitting inside content is likewise
//! read as a speaker change and absorbed. This is unavoidable given the format
//! and is deliberately accepted: the worst case is a mis-split or an absorbed
//! bracket, never a panic and never a dropped transcript -- and if such a stray
//! bracket makes time run backwards or strands text before an anchor, the
//! fail-closed policy below degrades the whole decode back to a single
//! unstructured segment. The reference decode does not emit bracketed numerics
//! as free text, so this stays a theoretical edge, but callers must treat the
//! segment overlay as best-effort structure over a plain-text signal, not a
//! guaranteed lossless parse of arbitrary transcript content.
//!
//! # Grammar
//!
//! Observed from the reference HF decode (`docs/model-audits/
//! moss-transcribe-diarize.md`, pinned in `executor.rs`'s golden fixtures): a
//! segment opens with a numeric time anchor `[t]`, a speaker tag `[Sxx]`, then
//! free text. The anchor that closes one segment doubles as the opener of the
//! next, so two anchors appear back to back between segments, e.g.
//! `...for you,[7.71][8.12][S01] ask what...`. A final trailing anchor closes
//! the last segment.
//!
//! # Fail-closed policy
//!
//! Any deviation from that grammar -- an unterminated `[`, a tag that is
//! neither a finite non-negative float nor `Sxx`, a time anchor that goes
//! backwards, or text/a speaker change emitted before the first anchor or
//! speaker tag has ever appeared -- returns a typed
//! [`MossTdSpeakerSegmentParseError`] instead of guessing at a boundary or
//! silently dropping the offending span. The caller treats any such error, and
//! the "well-formed but zero speaker tags found" case, the same way: this
//! decode's tag structure is not trustworthy, so it degrades to a single
//! speaker-less segment spanning the clip. The transcript *words* are never
//! dropped or rewritten -- only the structure overlay is withheld, and the
//! markup characters themselves are removed by the same rule the parser uses to
//! recognize them (see [`strip_moss_td_markup`]) so a degraded decode cannot
//! leak markers a successful one would have consumed. That mirrors this
//! crate's existing diarization degrade path (an empty turn list is a silent
//! no-op, never an error surfaced to the caller).
//!
//! A speaker-number *gap* (e.g. `S01` then `S05` with no `S02`-`S04` in
//! between) is deliberately NOT an error: the model's own numbering is passed
//! through verbatim, on the same "never invent speakers" principle as
//! `cohere_diarized_segments_from_generated_tokens`'s
//! `does_not_invent_speakers` test -- renumbering to close the gap would
//! fabricate an ordering/count the model never asserted.
