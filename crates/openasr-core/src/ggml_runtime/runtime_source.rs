///
/// # Content identity: hot/cold split
///
/// [`GgmlRuntimeSource::content_id`] resolves in two tiers:
///
/// * **Trusted (no hashing).** When the source's path has the content store's
///   object layout (`.../objects/sha256/<digest>/content`), falls under this
///   process's own resolved model-store root
///   (`content_store::default_models_root`), and the file was read-only at
///   open time, the digest is taken straight from the path via
///   `content_store::trusted_object_digest`. That trust is not a shortcut
///   around integrity -- it rests on `content_store`'s integrity chain: the
///   digest was established once over the bytes actually written (and checked
///   against the signed catalog above the store), the object has been sealed
///   read-only since, and `openasr model-pack verify` can re-prove the claim
///   on demand. The models-root anchor is what stops the shape alone from
///   being enough: a file elsewhere on disk laid out to look like an object
///   (a user-supplied pack, a dev fixture, an extracted archive) was never
///   admitted by this store and must not be trusted just because it parses.
///   Re-hashing a multi-gigabyte pack on every process start to re-derive
///   what admission already established is the exact per-request
///   full-file-sha256 cost this split exists to remove.
/// * **Hashed (lazy, memoized).** Any other path -- a user-supplied pack, an
///   unsealed object, a dev fixture, an object-shaped path outside the
///   resolved model store, or a process with no resolvable
///   `default_models_root` at all -- hashes the mapping this source already
///   holds open, once, and memoizes the result by [`StrongFileIdentity`]
///   through [`resolve_content_id`]. A seal lost to a permissions-stripping
///   backup restore therefore degrades gracefully: hashing slow path until
///   `verify` re-seals, never a wrong id.
///
/// The id is deliberately **not** computed at validation time on the hashed
/// tier: this constructor sits on the per-request admission path (see
