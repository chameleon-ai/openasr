//! Neural Voice Activity Detection.
//!
//! OpenASR ships exactly one VAD engine: FireRedVAD's **Stream-VAD**
//! checkpoint ([`firered_stream`], causal DFSMN, Apache-2.0). It is vendored
//! (~2.3 MB, baked in via `include_bytes!`, no ggml/.oasr/catalog
//! involvement), so it is always available. Parsed weights are admitted to
//! the installed [`crate::NativeExecutionServices`] root via [`shared_model`]
//! and shared by the batch provider and the streaming detector. Because the
//! checkpoint is strictly causal (no
//! lookahead), the same weights back:
//!
//! - realtime endpointing ([`crate::realtime::VadMode::ExternalProbability`],
//!   via [`FireRedStreamingVad`]),
//! - long-form speech slicing (the [`crate::longform::LongFormVadProvider`]
//!   seam, via [`FireRedStreamVadProvider`]), and
//! - diarization's speech-region resolution ([`crate::diarize::pipeline`]).
//!
//! The forward pass is validated bit-close (max abs prob error < 1e-3)
//! against a numpy reference reproduction of the upstream `DetectModel`
//! forward via a committed golden fixture (see [`firered_stream::tests`]),
//! and chunked streaming is verified bit-identical to the whole-utterance
//! batch path.
//!
//! The zero-dependency RMS energy gate (the long-form `EnergyLongFormVadProvider`,
//! [`crate::realtime::VadMode::Energy`] for realtime) remains available as an
//! explicit, independently useful mode -- not a VAD engine choice, but a
//! deliberately simpler alternative for callers that want no model
//! dependency at all. Selection is surface-specific: long-form picks the
//! energy gate only via the explicit `--segment-mode energy` slicing mode
//! (`resolve_longform_vad_provider` does not consult any env var and always
//! resolves Stream-VAD for VAD-based slicing); `OPENASR_VAD=energy` only
//! affects realtime (`crate::realtime::VadMode`). There is no other neural
//! engine and no runtime engine-selection mechanism between neural
//! implementations: Stream-VAD is not optional.
