//! The source-independent identity stage: turn scope-local speaker labels into
//! known people.
//!
//! # Scope is the load-bearing idea
//!
//! Segmentation answers "these turns are by the same speaker". That answer is
//! only valid inside the **scope** it was computed in -- one decode unit. A
//! source numbers speakers in arrival order within its own scope, so scope A's
//! `SPEAKER_01` and scope B's `SPEAKER_01` are two unrelated labels that happen
//! to collide. A whole-recording decode is one scope; a recording cut into
//! longform slices that an in-decoder-diarizing family decoded independently
//! (`arch::OpenAsrLongformSliceShape::ScopedSlices`) is one scope per slice.
//! Nothing about this stage depends on which of those produced its input, which
//! is the point of making scope explicit ([`SpeakerScope`]).
//!
//! Stitching scopes back together -- deciding that A's `SPEAKER_01` and B's
//! `SPEAKER_02` are one person -- is therefore not an optional nicety layered on
//! top of transcription; it is what makes the speaker labels of a multi-scope
//! transcript mean anything at all, and it can only be done from voice
//! evidence. That is this module's job, and it is why it works from embeddings
//! and never from labels: a label is a counter, not an identity. It happens in
//! two steps that must stay in this order: every scope's labels are first split
//! apart unconditionally ([`disambiguate_labels_across_scopes`]), then only
//! acoustic agreement puts any of them back together
//! ([`stitch_labels_across_scopes`], and enrolled-person matching further
//! down). Nothing in between is allowed to treat a shared number as a shared
//! person.
//!
//! # Erring toward anonymous
//!
//! A wrong name is worse than no name. A user who sees "Ada" believes it; being
//! told "Speaker 2" merely fails to help. So every gate here is one-sided: when
//! the evidence is thin or the match is borderline, the label stays anonymous
//! and the person is left for the user to identify. Concretely this stage
//! - matches through [`PersonMatcher::best_match`], the strict default gate
//!   (accept threshold **and** top1-vs-top2 margin, both from the embedder's
//!   calibration profile). It deliberately does not use
//!   `best_match_with_gates`, whose `threshold_tolerance` lowers the accept
//!   floor for the latency-bound streaming path -- a batch transcript has no
//!   such excuse;
//! - refuses to name a label backed by too little usable voice
//!   ([`MIN_NAMING_EVIDENCE_SECONDS`], measured independently of whatever
//!   segmenter produced the labels -- see that constant);
//! - emits a name or nothing, never a hedge. "Probably Ada" is not a state a
//!   non-technical user can act on, and it invites exactly the misplaced trust
//!   the strict gates exist to prevent.
//!
//! Anyone loosening these should read this paragraph first: the recall they
//! gain (a familiar voice occasionally not recognized, one manual tap to fix)
//! is being traded for transcripts that confidently attribute words to the
//! wrong person.
//!
//! # Refusing silently is a separate mistake
//!
//! Erring toward anonymous is about the *verdict*; it says nothing about
//! whether the verdict may be invisible. Every gate above therefore reports
//! why it refused, as a [`UnnamedSpeaker`] return value rather than only as an
//! `OPENASR_DIARIZE_DEBUG` line -- see [`naming`](super::naming) for why the
//! three refusal reasons are three different things for a user to do, and why
//! collapsing them into a bare `SPEAKER_01` reads as a broken feature.
//! Reporting the reason is explicitly **not** a licence to lower a gate so the
//! name appears instead.

/// enough to embed stably" cannot be false, and a segment too short to hold one
/// contributes nothing by construction (see [`evidence`]). A previous
/// `MIN_RELIABLE_EMBEDDING_SECONDS = 1.0` said the same thing about segments
/// and is gone with them -- the window is twice as long and, unlike a segment,
/// is guaranteed to be.
///
/// Total duration alone is the wrong measure, and the corpus shows why: a
/// label made of twenty sub-second "mm"s and a label with one continuous turn
/// can carry the same number of seconds while being worlds apart as evidence.
/// AISHELL-4 `L_R003S01C02` speaker `003-F` is exactly that -- 5.18s spread
/// over eight fragments of 0.39-0.93s, every one of them too short for a
/// trustworthy embedding, and a plain 3s total would have named her. Under
/// windowing she yields no window at all.
///
/// # This constant
///
/// How much voice a label needs before this stage will match it against
/// enrolled people at all, measured over the audio the surviving main-cluster
/// windows actually cover -- distinct audio, since consecutive windows overlap.
///
/// Naming a real person cannot be cheaper than inventing an anonymous one, and
/// the streaming path already requires 2.5s before it will create even an
/// anonymous session speaker (`streaming::MIN_NEW_SPEAKER_DURATION_S`), so 3s
/// is the floor consistency demands. It is also where the corpus is flat and
/// the two populations are cleanly apart: over those 45 speakers the reliable
/// seconds are 0, 0, 1.08, 1.29, 1.29, 1.32, 1.43, 1.70, 1.84, 1.98 | 4.28,
/// 4.84, 5.93, 9.40, ... -- **nothing at all lands between 2.0 and 4.3**, so
/// any threshold in 2.0-4.0 rejects the same ten walk-on speakers and keeps
/// the same thirty-five real participants.
///
/// This is deliberately one-sided, per this module's "erring toward
/// anonymous": the cost of rejecting is one familiar voice left as
/// "Speaker 2", the cost of accepting is a transcript that confidently
/// attributes a stranger's words to someone the user knows.
///
/// # Its relationship to the window count gate

/// Naming also requires [`MIN_PURITY_VERDICT_WINDOWS`] surviving windows, and

/// - `n` overlapping windows span
///   `WINDOW_SECONDS + (n - 1) * WINDOW_STEP_SECONDS` of audio;
/// - [`evidence::SEGMENT_EDGE_TRIM_SECONDS`] is charged at both ends of a turn
///   before windowing starts, so the turn must be that much longer again.
///
/// # Why the "+1" margin is still charged, even though reclaim exists
///
/// Main-cluster filtering used to discard a minority unconditionally, so a
/// planned-windows-minus-one margin was simply correct. It now reclaims that
/// minority whenever the split lands at or under `evidence`'s
/// `MIXED_MIN_SPLIT_DISTANCE` -- which real single-voice turns almost always
/// do (measured 0.055-0.253 there) -- so *most* single-voice labels no longer
/// lose anything here. The margin stays anyway, because reclaim is
/// conditional on distance alone, not on label size, and a real single voice
/// can still land above that distance by acoustic condition rather than
/// identity (`evidence`'s module docs cite `R8001_M8004` `SPEAKER_00#0`: 95%
/// one voice, split 0.80, never reclaimed). At the exact planned-window count
/// this constant assumes (six), that particular escape does not exist yet --
/// a six-window split can only be ruled single-voice through the same
/// distance check that reclaims it, since one window out of six is already
/// above the fraction floor that would otherwise excuse a large split
/// distance -- so the bare minimum turn this constant describes clears with
/// reclaim doing the work, not the margin. The margin is what keeps the
/// *promise* correct for longer single-voice labels, where a large-enough
/// window budget lets the fraction floor protect a label whose split distance
/// reclaim does not reach. Removing it would make this figure a claim that
/// happens to hold at the minimum length tested and silently stops holding
/// past it -- exactly the kind of promise this constant exists to rule out.
///
/// The seconds gate is folded in with a `max` rather than assumed smaller, so
/// retuning either constant keeps this honest, and
/// `the_advertised_speech_length_is_long_enough_to_actually_clear_both_gates`
/// runs the resulting figure through the real windowing rather than trusting
/// this arithmetic --
